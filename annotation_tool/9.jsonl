It was collected by tapping directly into some of the American telecommunication system's main arteries, they said.\n\nAs part of the program approved by President Bush for domestic surveillance without warrants, the N.S.A. has gained the cooperation of American telecommunications companies to obtain backdoor access to streams of domestic and international communications, the officials said.\n\nThe government's collection and analysis of phone and Internet traffic have raised questions among some law enforcement and judicial officials familiar with the program. One issue of concern to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has reviewed some separate warrant applications growing out of the N.S.A.'s surveillance program, is whether the court has legal authority over calls outside the United States that happen to pass through American-based telephonic \"switches,\" according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\n\"There was a lot of discussion about the switches\" in conversations with the court, a Justice Department official said, referring to the gateways through which much of the communications traffic flows. \"You're talking about access to such a vast amount of communications, and the question was, How do you minimize something that's on a switch that's carrying such large volumes of traffic? The court was very, very concerned about that.\"\n\nSince the disclosure last week of the N.S.A.'s domestic surveillance program, President Bush and his senior aides have stressed that his executive order allowing eavesdropping without warrants was limited to the monitoring of international phone and e-mail communications involving people with known links to Al Qaeda.\n\nWhat has not been publicly acknowledged is that N.S.A. technicians, besides actually eavesdropping on specific conversations, have combed through large volumes of phone and Internet traffic in search of patterns that might point to terrorism suspects. Some officials describe the program as a large data-mining operation.\n\nThe current and former government officials who discussed the program were granted anonymity because it remains classified.\n\nBush administration officials declined to comment on Friday on the technical aspects of the operation and the N.S.A.'s use of broad searches to look for clues on terrorists. Because the program is highly classified, many details of how the N.S.A. is conducting it remain unknown, and members of Congress who have pressed for a full Congressional inquiry say they are eager to learn more about the program's operational details, as well as its legality.\n\nOfficials in the government and the telecommunications industry who have knowledge of parts of the program say the N.S.A. has sought to analyze communications patterns to glean clues from details like who is calling whom, how long a phone call lasts and what time of day it is made, and the origins and destinations of phone calls and e-mail messages. Calls to and from Afghanistan, for instance, are known to have been of particular interest to the N.S.A. since the Sept. 11 attacks, the officials said.\n\nThis so-called \"pattern analysis\" on calls within the United States would, in many circumstances, require a court warrant if the government wanted to trace who calls whom.\n\nThe use of similar data-mining operations by the Bush administration in other contexts has raised strong objections, most notably in connection with the Total Information Awareness system, developed by the Pentagon for tracking terror suspects, and the Department of Homeland Security's Capps program for screening airline passengers. Both programs were ultimately scrapped after public outcries over possible threats to privacy and civil liberties.", "summary": "The volume of information harvested, without \r\ncourt warrants, is much larger than the White \r\nHouse has acknowledged.", "compression": 33.6363636364, "coverage": 0.9090909091, "density": 4.7272727273, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary"}

On the other are Pfizer shareholders, angry over the 46 percent decline in market value since Mr. McKinnell took the reins.\n\nSome shareholders are threatening to withhold votes for several Pfizer directors over Mr. McKinnell's pay. Pfizer, meanwhile, is fighting back in the proxy contest, working overtime to convince shareholders that its directors deserve support.\n\nAdding drama to this battle is the effect that withheld votes may have on Pfizer directors. Such acts of shareholder defiance are strictly symbolic; at most companies directors can win a seat if they receive one \"yes\" vote in an election. Last year, though, Pfizer changed its guidelines so that any director who received more \"withhold\" votes than \"for\" votes will have to resign. If the board rejects the resignation offer, it will publicly state why.\n\nLike many other companies, Pfizer has a mighty arsenal, backed by shrewd alliances and relationships with institutional shareholders. The Pfizer battle, governance experts say, illustrates an imbalance of power between company owners and managers that is prevalent today.\n\n\"The management has these unlimited resources to fight back, and the shareholders are pretty much powerless,\" said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group. \"The thing has gotten so out of hand that words almost fail me. The shareholders should not tolerate it.\"\n\nInstitutional shareholders, who vote the stock on behalf of their individual investors, are supposed to act in the best interests of those who own the stock, and the institutions questioned said they were careful to avoid conflicts in proxy votes. But shaking up the status quo may not always be in their own interest.\n\nPfizer is known for its assiduous courting of institutional shareholders. One way is through Margaret M. Foran, Pfizer's corporate secretary and vice president for corporate governance, who is co-chairwoman of the board at the Council of Institutional Investors, an influential organization of pension funds. She is also on the board of the International Corporate Governance Network, an institutional investor organization in London. Ms. Foran, who said she is a student of governance issues, added that her involvement in these organizations helped her stay current on best practices at corporations.\n\nMANY of Pfizer's biggest institutional stockholders also earn considerable fees for providing money management services to the company. These institutions could fear damaging such relationships by voting against the company. Some members of Pfizer's board serve on boards of firms that are among its larger shareholders, raising questions about their allegiances.\n\nManagement says Mr. McKinnell is being paid for 35 years of service in an industry that has very long business cycles for attaining measures of success established by the board. It says Pfizer's board continues to strengthen the connection between pay and performance.\n\n\"We have a duty to the shareholders to articulate and communicate the position of the board and I think that is what the company is intending to do,\" said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president emeritus at the University of Illinois and a member of Pfizer's board and compensation committee. \"Hank McKinnell's compensation is down sharply for the current year, but looked at both in the context of one year and multiple years and in terms of pension, the board has reviewed those issues, discussed them extensively and supports the decisions that have been made.\"\n\nBy contrast, a grass-roots group of businesspeople \u0097 Investors for Director Accountability \u0097 sees a pervasive problem in his pay. \"Mushrooming management compensation, unconnected to performance, is an obvious area where directors have failed the people they legally represent,\" the organization said last month. \"Shareholders should withhold their votes for the four nominees of the Pfizer board of directors who are members of the board's compensation committee. This would be a first step on a long road to restore director accountability to owners.\"", "summary": "The battle between Pfizer Inc.'s investors and its board illustrates an imbalance of power between company owners and managers that is prevalent today.", "compression": 33.88, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 11.72, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive", "annotation": "summary"}

So, why the connection between George and the beauty queen? Well, according to sources, Hamilton recently made the very smooth transition from interviewing a guest to dating a guest. Shortly after Smith's cheery Feb. 6 appearance on the \"George & Alana Show,\" Hamilton took Smith out on a dinner date. Hey, better to date a guest like Shawntel Smith than, say, Ed Begley Jr.\n\nSources say Smith did her guest spot and they just really hit it off. Hamilton, a Hall-of-Fame dame chaser, not too long ago said: \"I'm at a point where dating is boring. I like quiet.\" Don't hurt us man, we idolize you.\n\nMarcus Schenkenberg sitting in a barber's chair is like Cindy Crawford calling dermatologists to have the mole removed. It might sound shallow to you, but in the business of beauty, Marcus' new close-cropped hairstyle is a pretty risky move. We, of course, now like him more than ever and immediately make him eligible for our \"Against-the-Grain Hall of Fame.\"\n\n\"It's gonna lose me gigs, but it's also gonna get me gigs,\" Marcus told us while partying at Brinton Brewster's Wednesday night affairs at 40 Below. \"I just totally surprised the agencies. I didn't care.\" In fact, while Schenkenberg was in Italy, his New York agent got a call from another agent in Italy gushing about sightings of a kid who looks \"exactly like Marcus' little brother.\" Spooky.\n\nEither way, it hasn't stopped Hollywood from calling. Schenkenberg has already met with Zalman King and Joel Schumacher on future projects and just agreed to \"play a bad guy\" in the upcoming \"Prince Valiant\" film.\n\nNow that \"Saturday Night Live\" is making great strides at standing on the edge of comedy once again, it makes sense that their musical guests might represent that same sort of edge. (See Coolio, last week's performer.) Why then are some suits at the show sweating the appearance of next week's musical guest, Tupac Shakur?\n\n\"Maybe because he's probably gonna roll up with a posse of 40 guys,\" said a source close to the show. \"And, forget about backstage antics, you can never be too sure what he will do on stage.\" In addition, some say they're even expecting Snoop Doggy Dogg and Death Row Records' CEO Suge Knight to be part of his entourage, since this will be Tupac's first live TV performance since his incarceration and some expect his record label to make a major show of respect.\n\nFor those seeking the calmer side to the show, you'll just have to wait until Feb. 24 when Elle Macpherson hosts and Sting performs.\n\nGeorge Will's wife, Mari Maseng who penned Sen. Bob Dole's stodgy State-of-the-Union address response last month may be in hotter water with the majority leader than anyone thought.\n\nSources tell us the GOP front-runner was so angry about the entire situation involving Maseng and his widely panned response that he chose not to use a speech that Maseng wrote for this week's annual meeting of the National Governors' Association.\n\nFurthermore, in the speech Dole did use written by a staffer in his Senate office he made fun of his lame State-of-the-Union performance.\n\nSo, for those keeping score at home Mari isn't suffering writer's cramp.

The last time the NYPD was hitting that mark was in 1999.\n\nThe 12-minute high was a full minute slower than the same period in 1999 - clearly a cause for concern when the figure was released last month in the semiannual Mayor's Management Report. Giuliani ordered Kerik to do something about it.\n\nKerik responded by tracking response on a daily basis and holding precinct commanders accountable for increases the same way they are for violent crime.\n\n\"I don't think response times are where they should be,\" Kerik said. \"The only way to address it is the way I address everything else - start looking at this stuff daily.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the front-line supervisors know that we're going to be on top of them, they're going to be pro-active. The sergeant is going to be listening to the radio saying, 'Where's the cop?'\"\n\nA precinct-by-precinct review shows widely different average response times:\n\n* The busy 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn, posted the city's slowest time, at 15.8 minutes (down from 21.3 minutes); the 43rd Precinct in Soundview, the Bronx, was a close second, at 15 minutes.\n\n* The 6th Precinct in Greenwich Village and the 26th Precinct on the upper West Side had the best times, 6.9 minutes.\n\nThe fastest citywide response time the NYPD has recorded since it began tracking response time was 7.9 minutes in 1993; only 10 out of the city's 76 precincts came in under 8 minutes in the most recent survey.\n\n* The city's smallest precinct, the 28th in Harlem, which covers about half a square mile, took an average of 8.4 minutes to respond to a crime in progress; the largest, the 122nd in Staten Island (29 square miles), came in at 13.6 minutes.\n\n\"Obscene,\" is how Bob Holden, president of the Juniper Park Civic Association, describes the 14.6-minute response time of the 104th Precinct in Ridgewood, Queens.\n\n\"I don't think it's the cops' fault; I think there's been a lack of effort by 1 Police Plaza to solve it,\" Holden said.\n\nCity Councilman Sheldon Leffler (D-Queens), who is chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said Kerik is treating the issue more seriously than his predecessors did. Leffler said former Police Commissioners William Bratton and Howard Safir preferred to cite crime decreases as their measure of police efficiency.\n\n\"The fact that it has gone down by a minute in the last four months is good, but I think the public should realize it still reflects a continuing increase from 7.9 in 1993,\" Leffler said.\n\n\"The Giuliani administration has had police strategies in many different areas, but they have never, up until now, given the same effort to reducing the response time to crimes in progress.\"\n\nResponse time measures the period from when the caller gets the 911 operator on the line to the cops' arrival on the scene.\n\nUnder Kerik's new directive, response-time spreadsheets are dispatched daily to Police Headquarters for analysis. If a precinct shows a sharp spike, or a particular job stands out as taking a long time, Kerik's aides are on the phone to the local commander finding out what took so long.\n\nThe key to Deputy Inspector Robert Lucena's success in the 26th Precinct has been tracking the busiest periods for 911 calls there, then making sure cops' meal breaks aren't scheduled at the same time.\n\nInspector James Secreto of the 75th Precinct said cops sometimes forget to notify the dispatcher immediately upon arrival at the scene because they are often jumping out of the car to handle serious situations.\n\n\"We're making a more conscious effort to let the dispatcher know when we're on the scene,\" he said, adding that as of last week, the average had been lowered to about 13 minutes.\n\nGraphic: POLICE RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK\n\n6th Precinct: 6.9 minutes ...

Furious and hurt, O'Neal launched a media counterattack in which she charged that McEnroe was a \"cruel, cruel man\" and a \"sexual and physical bully.\"\n\nBut the 38-year-old Oscar- winner received less sympathy than she expected. \"Tatum honestly believed that the press and the public would feel sorry for her,\" a source told The Enquirer, out tomorrow.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on June 26 that O'Neal was \"currently in a rehab program in Los Angeles.\"\n\nHer manager, Jason Weinberg, told us yesterday that he didn't know whether or not O'Neal had been in Promises, but said, \"She couldn't be doing better now. The demand for her is very strong.\"\n\nShe's making her movie comeback - shooting \"The Technical Writer.\" She's also been offered several TV roles, said Weinberg.\n\nA rep for McEnroe, who has custody of their children, didn't return a call for comment on whether allegations of recent drug use would affect O'Neal's visitation arrangement.\n\nBut with her agent in talks with HarperCollins about her own memoir, Mac can be sure\n\nhe hasn't heard the last from his ex-wife.\n\nRosie O'Donnell may hear a lot of whimpering next week when she returns from her vacation to sort out the trouble at her magazine. New editor Susan Toepfer, who replaced O'Donnell's first editor, Cathy Cavender, has been at the mag for only a month. But Rosie loyalists are already kvetching.\n\n\"Everyone is uncomfortable and depressed,\" one insider tells us. \"They feel they're working on stuff that Rosie doesn't even know about. The staff is afraid of voicing their opinions to Susan, for fear of getting fired.\"\n\nO'Donnell has made it clear that she doesn't agree with Toepfer's story ideas and wants her out. She's gone so far as to hire former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White to represent her in negotiations with magazine publisher Gruner + Jahr USA, whose CEO, Daniel Brewster, wants Toepfer to stay.\n\nYesterday, Gunter Thielen, the new head of Bertelsmann, which owns G + J USA, stopped by the mag's offices to voice his support for Brewster.\n\nA G + J spokeswoman said Thielen didn't mention O'Donnell, but \"restated his support and confidence in Dan Brewster and his management team.\"\n\nA rep for O'Donnell would say only \"Rosie is very proud of the magazine and what it stands for.\"\n\nManhattan art gallery I-20 is stretching the definition of art, by mounting a show due to feature a bloody video.\n\nThe footage captures a 1996 massacre of Russian soldiers\n\nby Al Qaeda mercenaries in Chechnya.\n\nGallery owner Paul Judelson says that his star artist, Sergei Bugaev, known professionally as Afrika, recently obtained\n\nthe startling clip from Russian intelligence sources - and\n\nplans to work it into a November show.\n\nIn the video, a Russian military column \"walks into an ambush and is completely wiped out,\" Judelson says, adding that the tape will be edited down to 20 minutes from the original three-hour version.\n\n\"I don't see this work as pandering to sensationalism, like a snuff video, although it plainly shows the massacre of the Russian soldiers,\" he says.\n\nJudelson calls the massacre \"a prelude to 9/11.\" He tells Webster Hall curator Baird Jones that, in the context of world terrorism, \"The violence in this video is relevant just the same way that a news broadcast of violence is necessary.\"\n\nJesse Ventura's love for stogies might keep him in Cuba longer than he expects. The Minnesota governor is heading to Havana at the end of next month to participate in the\n\nU.S. Food and Agribusiness Exhibition, a showcase for American edibles. The group will cover his travel expenses, and he's been asked to join a ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n\nThe former wrestler said he's going to Cuba to \"learn about it firsthand,\" he told a radio audience on Monday.\n\nGag us with a spoon.\n\nThough Reese Witherspoon plays a demur Southern belle in her upcoming film \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" her favorite scene was far from ladylike.\n\n\"Puking was my favorite thing,\" she declares in the new issue of W.\n\nEschewing the special effects of, say, Industrial Light & Magic, Witherspoon reveals the secret formula of her faux Technicolor yawn. \"It was corn chowder,\" she says. \"Don't tell anybody. And we did lots of takes, 'cause I was having so much fun. I just love pretending to vomit!\"\n\nIt seems the actress can't get enough of the topic. It even came up while furniture-shopping with her husband, Ryan Phillippe. \"We looked at some fancy things, and Ryan asked, 'What if a kid vomits on that?' \"\n\nAlthough the actress has an obsession with what goes out, she admits she's big on the reverse. \"I like everything,\"\n\nshe tells W. \"I eat all the time. Particularly having a kid. Somebody's got to eat, right?\"\n\nOzzy Osbourne and his wife, Sharon, are facing a new legal bummer. In a lawsuit just filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, entertainment network Threshold.tv says the Osbournes' deal with MTV violates an intellectual-property- rights agreement the Osbournes' company, Monowise, made with Threshold in\n\nThe complaint alleges that, under its contract, Threshold acquired exclusive rights to the rocker's \"name, likeness, image, identity, persona, trademarks and right of publicity.\" Larry Kasanoff, who heads up Threshold, wants to be declared the owner of the MTV series \"and all derivatives therefrom.\"\n\nENRIQUE IGLESIAS will fire up the \"NFL Kickoff Live from Times Square,\" joining Bon Jovi and other acts Sept. 5. Iglesias' performance in the city's busy epicenter will lead into the season opener between the 49ers and the Giants at Giants Stadium.\n\nLES MOONVES apparently doesn't want anyone thinking he's playing favorites with his network stars. The CBS president declined to be photographed with \"Early Show\" anchor Julie Chen during the arrivals at Monday's premiere of \"Mostly Martha.\" He did consent to join Chen in a group shot later at the dinner thrown by Gourmet magazine editor Ruth Reichl\n\nLAUREN BUSH needed a dose of glamour after spending six weeks backpacking with friends in France, Italy and Spain.
