For me, it recalled a command from my schoolboy past: \u201cWrite a Note on the Two-Nation Theory.\u201d\n\nIt was a way of scoring easy points on the history exam, and of using new emotions and impressive-sounding words. I began my answer like this:\n\nThe Two-Nation Theory is the Theory that holds that the Hindus and Muslims of the Indian Subcontinent are Two Distinct and Separate Nations. It is a Theory that is supported by Numerous Facts and Figures. During the War of Independence of 1857 the Muslim rulers of India were defeated by the British. Suddenly the Hindus, who had always held a grudge against the Muslims for conquering them, began to collaborate with the new British rulers. They joined British schools, worked in British offices and began to make large amounts of money, while the Muslims, who were Discriminated Against, became poorer and poorer. It was now Undisputable that the Hindus and the Muslims were Two Distinct and Separate Nations, and it was becoming necessary for the Muslims to demand a Distinct and Separate Homeland for themselves in the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nTo that point, my \u201cnote\u201d had only built up the atmosphere of mistrust and hostility between Hindus and Muslims. It had yet to give examples of the Distinctness and Separateness of the two communities (such as that Hindus worshipped the cow but Muslims ate it), of Hindu betrayals and conspiracies (they wanted Hindi, not Urdu, to be the national language). And it had still to name and praise the saddened Muslim clerics, reformers and poets who had first noted these \u201cundisputable\u201d differences.\n\nI got points for every mini-note that I stretched into a full page, which was valid if it gave one important date and one important name, each highlighted for the benefit of the teacher. This was because the teacher couldn\u2019t really read English, and could award points only to answers that carefully showcased their Facts and Figures.\n\nAfter the exam I would go home. Here the Two-Nation Theory fell apart. I was part-Shiite (my mother\u2019s family), part-Sunni (my father\u2019s family) and part-nothing (neither of my parents was sectarian). There were other things: the dark-skinned man who swabbed the floors of the house was a Christian; the jovial, foul-mouthed, red-haired old woman who visited my grandmother every few months was rumored to be an Ahmadi. (It was a small group, I had been told, that considered itself Muslim but had been outlawed by the government.)\n\nBut even more than these visible religious variations, I was more aware of things like caste and money: my mother\u2019s family was upper caste, claiming a magical blood bond with the Prophet Muhammad, and owned large tracts of land in the countryside. My father\u2019s relatives, however, were undisguised converts from Hinduism who had fled their villages long ago and now lived in the city, where they were always running out of money, working in government offices and selling homemade furniture and gambling (and losing) on the stock market.\n\nThe Two-Nation Theory allowed only for the simple categories of Hindu and Muslim, one for India and the other for Pakistan; it had no room for inner complications like Shiite and Sunni and Christian and Ahmadi. (I had yet to learn that more than a million Hindus still lived in Pakistan.) It also required the abolition of magical blood claims and landholdings and stock markets, so that our personalities and situations could be determined purely by our religious beliefs.\n\nBut I knew that things weren\u2019t really like that. And this was something I knew from the beginning, and lived with quite comfortably: the history in my textbook was Distinct and Separate from the histories of real people.\n\nSome years later, in a secluded college library in Massachusetts, I read a very different account of the Two-Nation Theory. Here I learned that it was devised in the 1930s by a group of desperate Muslim politicians who wanted to extract some constitutional concessions from the British before they left India.\n\nThe Muslims of India, these politicians were saying in their political way, were a \u201cdistinct group\u201d with their own \u201chistory and culture.\u201d But really, the book told me, all they wanted was special protection for the poor Muslim minorities in soon-to-be-independent, mostly Hindu India.\n\nBut the politicians\u2019 gamble failed; they were taken up on their bluff and were given a separate country, abruptly and violently cut-up, two far-apart chunks of Muslim-majority areas (but what about the poor Muslim minorities that were still stuck in Hindu-majority areas!) that its founders (but it was a mistake!) now had to justify with the subtleties of their theory.\n\nIt was like a punishment.\n\nOne by one, the founders died \u2014 the most important, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, just a year after Pakistan\u2019s birth. Their theory could have died with them. What was the use now of the idea of Muslim specialness \u2014 the distinctiveness and separateness of Indian Muslims \u2014 in an independent, Muslim-majority country?\n\nAli Sethi is the author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Wish Maker,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a novel.", "summary": "A lethal attack on two mosques of a minority sect was the result of years of ignoring religious diversity.", "compression": 52.5, "coverage": 0.65, "density": 0.75, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Chris Christie vaulted into office as a strict fiscal conservative. In his first year in the job, he won national attention as a tough-talking manager whose budget-slashing, union-bashing ways seemed to be all about the money.\n\nThe National Review and Rush Limbaugh quoted admiringly from a document far from the usual political red meat: Mr. Christie\u2019s 2010 budget address.\n\nBut the last few months have revealed a governor whose conservatism is not just economic. In his statements, budget moves and quiet administrative actions, Mr. Christie has taken strong positions on abortion and medical marijuana; while his positions on these issues had been clear, he had said or done little about them. And he has spoken up on matters he had previously not addressed at all, like family planning and global warming \u2014 suggesting that human activity may not be causing the planet to heat up.\n\n\u201cHe is absolutely the most conservative governor we have had in the modern history of the state,\u201d said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. \u201cChristie has revealed a number of views that we didn\u2019t see before, or barely saw, on things that were not on anybody\u2019s radar screen in the 2009 election or his first months in office.\u201d\n\nOther recent Republican governors of New Jersey, like Christine Todd Whitman and Thomas H. Kean, have been all-around moderates \u2014 like many voters in the Democratic-leaning state \u2014 and Mr. Christie\u2019s new outspokenness could complicate his political future there.\n\nBut his positions could also broaden his appeal to the fiscal conservatives and union opponents who have already given Mr. Christie a national following, and to social conservatives who have had less reason to notice him.\n\nThe governor\u2019s growing discussion of nonfiscal issues has fueled talk of him as a presidential contender \u2014 though he vows in every imaginable way not to run in 2012 \u2014 and fed speculation that he is playing to the conservatives around the country who dominate Republican primaries and caucuses.\n\n\u201cI think that that\u2019s part of it, that there\u2019s some goal beyond New Jersey,\u201d even if it is not the White House, said Jennifer E. Duffy, senior editor of The Cook Political Report. \u201cIt gives him a more national audience for any issues he wants to raise, and it certainly could help with fund-raising.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s chief political strategist, Michael DuHaime, said any apparent shift in emphasis was not about political calculation, but more about the questions that come Mr. Christie\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cHe is who he is, and he\u2019s been clear about what his issue positions were on anything that anybody asked him about,\u201d Mr. DuHaime said. He warned against applying easy labels to Mr. Christie, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s no doubt conservative on the issues, but he\u2019s far from dogmatic.\u201d\n\nMr. Christie had little political experience to define him when he ran for governor in 2009; he had been a lawyer and a lobbyist, a one-term county freeholder and the United States attorney for New Jersey.\n\nDuring the campaign, the state\u2019s deep financial trouble took center stage. Mr. Christie focused on the state\u2019s high taxes, played down his opposition to abortion, and aligned himself with President Obama on subjects like education reform and promoting wind and solar energy. And the new governor was a blank slate on some issues, like global warming.\n\nIn office, he eliminated the state\u2019s Office of Climate Change, cut funding for clean energy programs and eliminated New Jersey\u2019s share of financing for a 10-state greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program that is anathema to many conservatives.\n\nBut those were billed as pragmatic, budgetary moves. In November, Mr. Christie went further: He revealed that he was skeptical that human activity was responsible for climate change. Responding to a question at a public forum in Toms River, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to need more science to prove something one way or the other.\u201d\n\nOn March 11, he pulled New Jersey out of a multistate lawsuit aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions from power plants, and on March 24, he said he might also withdraw entirely from the cap-and-trade program.", "summary": "Gov.

Almost 50 years. But the sensation of seeing \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d for the first time is still with me, as if it had been yesterday.\n\nWhere did I see it? Was it at the Art Theater on Eighth Street? Or was it the Beekman? I don\u2019t remember, but I do remember the charge that ran through me the first time I heard that opening musical theme \u2014 ominous, staccato, plucked out on strings, so simple, so stark, like the horns that announce the next tercio during a bullfight. And then, the movie. A Mediterranean cruise, bright sunshine, in black and white widescreen images unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen \u2014 so precisely composed, accentuating and expressing ... what? A very strange type of discomfort. The characters were rich, beautiful in one way but, you might say, spiritually ugly. Who were they to me? Who would I be to them?\n\nThey arrived on an island. They split up, spread out, sunned themselves, bickered. And then, suddenly, the woman played by Lea Massari, who seemed to be the heroine, disappeared. From the lives of her fellow characters, and from the movie itself. Another great director did almost exactly the same thing around that time, in a very different kind of movie. But while Hitchcock showed us what happened to Janet Leigh in \u201cPsycho,\u201d Michelangelo Antonioni never explained what had happened to Massari\u2019s Anna. Had she drowned? Had she fallen on the rocks? Had she escaped from her friends and begun a new life? We never found out.\n\nInstead the film\u2019s attention shifted to Anna\u2019s friend Claudia, played by Monica Vitti, and her boyfriend Sandro, played by Gabriele Ferzetti. They started to search for Anna, and the picture seemed to become a kind of detective story. But right away our attention was drawn away from the mechanics of the search, by the camera and the way it moved. You never knew where it was going to go, who or what it was going to follow. In the same way the attentions of the characters drifted: toward the light, the heat, the sense of place. And then toward one another.\n\nSo it became a love story. But that dissolved too. Antonioni made us aware of something quite strange and uncomfortable, something that had never been seen in movies. His characters floated through life, from impulse to impulse, and everything was eventually revealed as a pretext: the search was a pretext for being together, and being together was another kind of pretext, something that shaped their lives and gave them a kind of meaning.\n\nThe more I saw \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d \u2014 and I went back many times \u2014 the more I realized that Antonioni\u2019s visual language was keeping us focused on the rhythm of the world: the visual rhythms of light and dark, of architectural forms, of people positioned as figures in a landscape that always seemed terrifyingly vast. And there was also the tempo, which seemed to be in sync with the rhythm of time, moving slowly, inexorably, allowing what I eventually realized were the emotional shortcomings of the characters \u2014 Sandro\u2019s frustration, Claudia\u2019s self-deprecation \u2014 quietly to overwhelm them and push them into another \u201cadventure,\u201d and then another and another. Just like that opening theme, which kept climaxing and dissipating, climaxing and dissipating. Endlessly.\n\nWhere almost every other movie I\u2019d seen wound things up, \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d wound them down. The characters lacked either the will or the capacity for real self-awareness. They only had what passed for self-awareness, cloaking a flightiness and lethargy that was both childish and very real. And in the final scene, so desolate, so eloquent, one of the most haunting passages in all of cinema, Antonioni realized something extraordinary: the pain of simply being alive. And the mystery.\n\n\u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d gave me one of the most profound shocks I\u2019ve ever had at the movies, greater even than \u201cBreathless\u201d or \u201cHiroshima, Mon Amour\u201d (made by two other modern masters, Jean-Luc Godard and Alain Resnais, both of them still alive and working). Or \u201cLa Dolce Vita.\u201d At the time there were two camps, the people who liked the Fellini film and the ones who liked \u201cL\u2019Avventura.\u201d I knew I was firmly on Antonioni\u2019s side of the line, but if you\u2019d asked me at the time, I\u2019m not sure I would have been able to explain why. I loved Fellini\u2019s pictures and I admired \u201cLa Dolce Vita,\u201d but I was challenged by \u201cL\u2019Avventura.\u201d Fellini\u2019s film moved me and entertained me, but Antonioni\u2019s film changed my perception of cinema, and the world around me, and made both seem limitless. (It was two years later when I caught up with Fellini again, and had the same kind of epiphany with \u201c8 \u00bd.\u201d)\n\nThe people Antonioni was dealing with, quite similar to the people in F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novels (of which I later discovered that Antonioni was very fond), were about as foreign to my own life as it was possible to be. But in the end that seemed unimportant. I was mesmerized by \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d and by Antonioni\u2019s subsequent films, and it was the fact that they were unresolved in any conventional sense that kept drawing me back. They posed mysteries \u2014 or rather the mystery, of who we are, what we are, to each other, to ourselves, to time. You could say that Antonioni was looking directly at the mysteries of the soul. That\u2019s why I kept going back. I wanted to keep experiencing these pictures, wandering through them. I still do.\n\nAntonioni seemed to open up new possibilities with every movie. The last seven minutes of \u201cL\u2019Eclisse,\u201d the third film in a loose trilogy he began with \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d (the middle film was \u201cLa Notte\u201d), were even more terrifying and eloquent than the final moments of the earlier picture. Alain Delon and Ms. Vitti make a date to meet, and neither of them show up. We start to see things \u2014 the lines of a crosswalk, a piece of wood floating in a barrel \u2014 and we begin to realize that we\u2019re seeing the places they\u2019ve been, empty of their presence. Gradually Antonioni brings us face to face with time and space, nothing more, nothing less. And they stare right back at us. It was frightening, and it was freeing. The possibilities of cinema were suddenly limitless.\n\nWe all witnessed wonders in Antonioni\u2019s films \u2014 those that came after, and the extraordinary work he did before \u201cL\u2019Avventura,\u201d pictures like \u201cLa Signora Senza Camelie,\u201d \u201cLe Amiche,\u201d \u201cIl Grido\u201d and \u201cCronaca di un Amore,\u201d which I discovered later. So many marvels \u2014 the painted landscapes (literally painted, long before CGI) of \u201cRed Desert\u201d and \u201cBlowup,\u201d and the photographic detective story in that later film, which ultimately led further and further away from the truth; the mind-expanding ending of \u201cZabriskie Point,\u201d so reviled when it came out, in which the heroine imagines an explosion that sends the detritus of the Western world cascading across the screen in super slow motion and vivid color (for me Antonioni and Godard were, among other things, truly great modern painters); and the remarkable last shot of \u201cThe Passenger,\u201d where the camera moves slowly out the window and into a courtyard, away from the drama of Jack Nicholson\u2019s character and into the greater drama of wind, heat, light, the world unfolding in time.\n\nI crossed paths with Antonioni a number of times over the years. Once we spent Thanksgiving together, after a very difficult period in my life, and I did my best to tell him how much it meant to me to have him with us. Later, after he\u2019d had a stroke and lost the power of speech, I tried to help him get his project \u201cThe Crew\u201d off the ground \u2014 a wonderful script written with his frequent collaborator Mark Peploe, unlike anything else he\u2019d ever done, and I\u2019m sorry it never happened.\n\nBut it was his images that I knew, much better than the man himself. Images that continue to haunt me, inspire me.

The bureau contends that their numbers have become unmanageable. And it says it has little choice but to bring them to enclosed pastures so that other animals can share the land. Horse advocates counter that the horses should be allowed to live freely.\n\nThe bureau estimates that about 37,300 wild horses and burros roam on federally managed rangeland in 10 Western states and that nearly 50,000 additional animals are being cared for at short-term corrals and long-term pastures. With essentially no natural predators, herds typically double every four years.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences report found that the bureau had most likely undercounted the horses by 10 to 50 percent. It also said that the bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse removals might inadvertently allow the animal population to swell by reducing competition for forage.\n\nThe report recommended that more fertility control drugs be used as an alternative, a departure from the bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current approach.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt needs to be used in a consistent, widespread manner, which has not been done today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Guy Palmer, a veterinarian at Washington State University and the chairman of the committee that conducted the study.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn theory, you could continue the status quo if the American public is willing to continue to pay for long-term holding pastures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Palmer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, there are growing concerns that this is economically unsustainable. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what the public expects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAccording to the bureau, the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget ballooned to $75 million in 2012 from about $20.4 million in 2000, driven primarily by the rising cost of holding horses and burros.\n\nIn its research, the National Academy of Sciences did not specifically address the issue of roundups, which involve helicopters corralling wild horses into traps and have become a rallying cry for critics who say they are dangerous and inhumane. Nonetheless, horse advocates said the findings affirmed their concerns by calling for changes in the program.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe report is a powerful validation of what wild horse advocates have been saying for years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Suzanne Roy, director of the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe report delivers a strong case for an immediate halt to the roundup and removal of wild horses from the range, an increase in wild horse and burro population levels and implementation of in-the-wild management using available fertility control options.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA bureau spokesman, Tom Gorey, said the bureau needed and wanted to do a better job managing the animals, but was well aware the program was in a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrisis\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it was running out of holding space. Mr. Gorey also pointed out that because fertility control treatments lasted only one to two years, some horse removals would have to continue.\n\nLeaving the population control to nature, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould subject horses and burros to mass starvation and dehydration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that laissez-faire style is something the American public or Congress would support.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Gorey noted that the conclusion that wild horses had been undercounted undermined assertions from animal rights advocates that the program was deliberately overstating the problem \u00e2\u0080\u009cto disguise an alleged agenda of \u00e2\u0080\u0098managing for extinction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a statement, Neil Kornze, the bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal deputy director, said the bureau was open to more options to better control the wild horse population and help the program become more cost effective. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur agency is committed to protecting and managing these iconic animals for current and future generations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.", "summary": "The National Academy of Sciences said a controversial policy of moving animals to holding facilities as a means of population control was ineffective.", "compression": 37.75, "coverage": 0.9166666667, "density": 4.8333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Despite the worst economy in decades, the cash welfare rolls have barely budged.\n\nFaced with flat federal financing and rising need, Arizona is one of 16 states that have cut their welfare caseloads further since the start of the recession \u2014 in its case, by half. Even as it turned away the needy, Arizona spent most of its federal welfare dollars on other programs, using permissive rules to plug state budget gaps.\n\nThe poor people who were dropped from cash assistance here, mostly single mothers, talk with surprising openness about the desperate, and sometimes illegal, ways they make ends meet. They have sold food stamps, sold blood, skipped meals, shoplifted, doubled up with friends, scavenged trash bins for bottles and cans and returned to relationships with violent partners \u2014 all with children in tow.\n\nEsmeralda Murillo, a 21-year-old mother of two, lost her welfare check, landed in a shelter and then returned to a boyfriend whose violent temper had driven her away. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who to turn to,\u201d she said.\n\nMaria Thomas, 29, with four daughters, helps friends sell piles of brand-name clothes, taking pains not to ask if they are stolen. \u201cI don\u2019t know where they come from,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just helping get rid of them.\u201d\n\nTo keep her lights on, Rosa Pena, 24, sold the groceries she bought with food stamps and then kept her children fed with school lunches and help from neighbors. Her post-welfare credo is widely shared: \u201cI\u2019ll do what I have to do.\u201d\n\nCritics of the stringent system say stories like these vindicate warnings they made in 1996 when President Bill Clinton fulfilled his pledge to \u201cend welfare as we know it\u201d: the revamped law encourages states to withhold aid, especially when the economy turns bad.\n\nThe old program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, dates from the New Deal; it gave states unlimited matching funds and offered poor families extensive rights, with few requirements and no time limits. The new program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, created time limits and work rules, capped federal spending and allowed states to turn poor families away.\n\n\u201cMy take on it was the states would push people off and not let them back on, and that\u2019s just what they did,\u201d said Peter B. Edelman, a law professor at Georgetown University who resigned from the Clinton administration to protest the law. \u201cIt\u2019s been even worse than I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nBut supporters of the current system often say lower caseloads are evidence of decreased dependency. Many leading Republicans are pushing for similar changes to much larger programs, like Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nRepresentative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the top House Republican on budget issues, calls the current welfare program \u201can unprecedented success.\u201d Mitt Romney, who leads the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has said he would place similar restrictions on \u201call these federal programs.\u201d One of his rivals, Rick Santorum, calls the welfare law a source of spiritual rejuvenation.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t just cut the rolls, but it saved lives,\u201d Mr. Santorum said, giving the poor \u201csomething dependency doesn\u2019t give: hope.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama spoke favorably of the program in his 2008 campaign \u2014 promoting his role as a state legislator in cutting the Illinois welfare rolls. But he has said little about it as president.\n\nEven in the 1996 program\u2019s early days, when jobs were plentiful, a subset of families appeared disconnected \u2014 left with neither welfare nor work. Their numbers were growing before the recession and seem to have surged since then.\n\nWhile data on the very poor is limited and subject to challenge, recent studies have found that as many as one in every four low-income single mothers are jobless and without cash aid \u2014 roughly four million women and children. Many of the mothers have problems like addiction or depression, which can make assisting them politically unpopular, and they have received little attention in a downturn that has produced an outpouring of concern for the middle class.", "summary": "Some recipients of aid under the Clinton-era Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program have taken desperate measures to make ends meet.", "compression": 39.125, "coverage": 0.75, "density": 2.1666666667, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

I confess that I cheated, as I have family members who live about an hour out of the city center, and with whom I stayed for most of my trip.\n\nI did spend a night at the Silka West Kowloon Hotel, paying $157 for a double room. The hotel was bare-bones and my room slightly cramped, but it felt safe and was reasonably clean.\n\nIf you want to go the hostel route, the Ashoka Hostel has beds in mixed dorm rooms that run around $15 to $20. (Its website didn\u2019t work for me; use a site like Hostelworld to book instead.)\n\nThe Mei Ho House, a converted 1950s resettlement block, has double rooms that run around 1,250 Hong Kong dollars a night (about $161) and dormitory beds for about 290 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nBeyond lodging, travel essentials include a SIM card for your phone and an Octopus pass, a rechargeable card used to get around on public transportation. I bought my SIM card at one of the ubiquitous 7-Elevens in the city. For 140 dollars (less than $20), I got a local calling plan and five gigabytes of data \u2014 plenty for a short trip. I primarily used the data for maps and train and bus schedules (Google Maps does a decent job).\n\nThe Octopus card is used on the train, bus and even in some stores and restaurants. The cards can be purchased for 150 dollars (50 of which is a refundable deposit) from the service centers at most Mass Transit Railway (M.T.R.) stations.\n\nThe Hong Kong subway is exceptional: clean, efficient and inexpensive, though train cars are often overcrowded. Fares typically range from 3 to 10 dollars, and rarely over 20, depending on the distance. Buses are slightly less predictable, but necessary to get to places the train doesn\u2019t reach. Double-decker buses are common, as are smaller 16-seaters.\n\nThe winding, narrow streets of Kowloon can be difficult to navigate, but I was lucky enough to have a resource in Daisann McLane, a former Frugal Traveler columnist who now lives most of the year in Hong Kong.\n\nWe met on a slightly brisk evening in Tsim Sha Tsui, the glittering, shopping-heavy (and fairly tourist-laden) area of Kowloon near the harbor. She immediately led me out of the neighborhood farther north, promising me a more local experience.\n\n\u201cWhen the weather starts to chill, everyone lines up for bo zai fan,\u201d she said, referring to clay pot rice, a traditional Cantonese dish. We exited the Yau Ma Tei M.T.R. station after a short ride (4.50 dollars) and almost immediately saw a line down Arthur Street at the popular Four Seasons Pot Rice.\n\nWe lined up at the slightly less popular, but still excellent, Hing Kee Claypot Rice, dodging an imperious dishwasher carrying a load of bowls as we joined the line. \u201cIn Hong Kong,\u201d Ms. McLane said, \u201cthe dishwashers get paid more than the cooks.\u201d If the dishwasher stops working, the whole restaurant shuts down.\n\nI ordered a bowl of clay pot rice with white eel (58 dollars), and we shared a fried pancake dotted with fat, juicy oysters (35 dollars). The clay pot emerged perilously hot, the rice audibly crackling under slices of bone-in eel. We crunched on the slightly burned bits of rice from the bottom of the bowl. It was simple, warm and comforting.\n\nAfterward, we walked over to the Yau Ma Tei wholesale fruit market, in the shadow of crumbling, rickety old shophouses. The market, which is active throughout the night, really ramps up in the early morning hours. Some of the fruit is outrageously expensive, and that helps explain why fruit is such a common gift in Chinese culture. A beautiful imported Japanese watermelon was an absurd 350 dollars \u2014 nearly $50. I bought a few apples for my grandmother and paid a more reasonable 12 dollars each.\n\nOther worthwhile attractions in Kowloon are cheaper still: The Hong Kong Museum of History has some fantastic, informative exhibits and is free. There are areas dedicated to the country\u2019s maritime beginnings, as well as rice cultivation, Chinese opera and the traditions of burning incense and paper offerings. There are impressive detailed replicas of streets and businesses as the exhibit moves chronologically forward through the cession of Hong Kong to the British through the Japanese occupation during World War II.\n\nOn another day, I went for a walk through Kowloon City, a section of town that partly includes an actual walled city with a history that can be traced back centuries and was demolished in the 1990s (it\u2019s now a public park).\n\nI went to the Lian Fa Cafe, a cozy restaurant that specializes in traditional Hong Kong cafe cuisine, a mishmash of Chinese and Western cooking. I ordered a fat piece of French toast with a thick slice of butter and a floral Hong Kong milk tea for 38 dollars.\n\nFrom there, I strolled through the Kowloon Walled City Park, stopping to look at the ruins of the original south gate of the city.\n\nUltimately, though, the markets are what truly capture the essence of Hong Kong. As my grandmother and I walked that afternoon among the busy vendors on that not-really-pedestrianized Kweilin Street in Sham Shui Po, I asked her about Hong Kong\u2019s huge, distinctive apartment blocks, the facades of which are dotted with air-conditioners and drying clothing. \u201cPeople were living in shanty towns in the hills after the war, so the government built all of this housing,\u201d she said.\n\nWe took a turn into the multilevel Pei Ho street market, a sobering, indoor scene of fresh produce, live chickens, quivering pig carcasses, slithering eels in Styrofoam crates and nearly anything else you could think to eat.\n\nOn the top floor of the market, we grabbed a very good lunch of steamed pomfret with black bean sauce, greens and a half chicken for 165 dollars at the New Kam Dor Po Kitchen on the top floor of the market, then tried to find her childhood home on Kweilin Street.\n\nWe reached the address, only to find that the building had been torn down long ago. \u201cOh, of course it\u2019s gone,\u201d said my grandmother, unsurprised. Everything had changed so much, she said, but the spirit of the place was more or less the same. And with that, she happily posed for a picture in front of the new building that stood at her old address.\n\nAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Hong Kong. It is a city, not a country.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on November 27, 2016, on page TR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Markets Rule in Hong Kong\u2019s Kowloon.

Kane, Pennsylvania\u2019s brightest rising star when she was elected attorney general less than four years ago, came to a humiliating close on Monday when a judge sentenced her to 10 to 23 months in prison for her conviction on charges of perjury and abuse of her office.\n\nMs. Kane, 50, rose to power as a Democratic outsider with no political experience, vowing to shake to its foundations the state\u2019s male-dominated, corruption-prone political establishment that she mocked as \u201cthe Harrisburg old boys.\u201d At times she succeeded, forcing the ouster of State Supreme Court justices, prosecuting government officials and clashing repeatedly with one of her predecessors, Tom Corbett, a Republican who had become governor.\n\nBut she soon created a scandal of her own, illegally leaking grand jury records in an attempt to discredit a critic and then lying about it to a different grand jury. In August, a Common Pleas Court jury here found her guilty of two felony perjury charges and seven misdemeanor counts, forcing her to resign from office.\n\nShe broke down in tears on Monday while testifying at her sentencing hearing, pleading with the judge to consider her two teenage sons.\n\n\u201cMaybe I deserve everything I get; they don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not going to ask for your mercy because I don\u2019t care about me anymore.\u201d\n\nCalled to testify on her behalf, her son Chris, 15, said: \u201cMy mom is like my rock. We just know that we can\u2019t lose our mom.\u201d\n\nShe faced a maximum sentence of 12 to 24 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that the loss of her career and reputation was punishment enough.\n\nJudge Wendy Demchick-Alloy, however, said, \u201cAny lesser sentence than total confinement will absolutely depreciate the seriousness of the crime.\u201d\n\nMs. Kane, who had no visible reaction to the sentence, will remain free on bail pending an appeal.\n\nA daughter of a janitor and a secretary, Ms. Kane grew up in Scranton and worked there as an assistant district attorney, specializing in prosecuting sex crimes. She married Christopher Kane, whose family owns a successful trucking business; she and her husband are now separated and in divorce proceedings.\n\nWhen she began her 2012 run for attorney general, she was considered a long shot, virtually unknown in political circles, but her husband put more than $2 million into her campaign.\n\nMs. Kane emphasized her status as the outsider and the only woman in the race. She charged that Governor Corbett, when he was attorney general, had dragged his feet for years over whether to bring child molestation charges against Jerry Sandusky, a retired assistant football coach at Penn State, who was eventually convicted.\n\nAfter taking office in January 2013, she started an investigation into the Sandusky case. It did not find any misconduct in the way the case had been handled, but it uncovered thousands of emails sent by state officials with pornographic, racist or sexist content.\n\nAs Ms. Kane\u2019s own legal fortunes deteriorated over the past two years, she released troves of bombshell emails, forcing the resignations of two State Supreme Court justices and some officials who had worked in the attorney general\u2019s office under Mr. Corbett.\n\nIt was one of several battles she fought with the state\u2019s mostly Republican establishment, at first earning widespread praise as well as condemnation.\n\nIn her first few months in office, she rejected Mr. Corbett\u2019s plan to privatize management of the state lottery, refused to defend in court the state\u2019s ban on gay marriage, offered only a lukewarm defense of a voter identification law, and exposed corruption at the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. She also gave a promotion to her twin sister \u2014 who had worked for years in the attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 prompting accusations of nepotism.\n\nIn those first months, she also shut down a secret sting case that had started under Mr. Corbett and had recorded four state legislators and a judge \u2014 all Democrats from Philadelphia \u2014 accepting illegal gifts. A year later, when The Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that the operation had taken place and that Ms. Kane had shut it down, she faced claims of partisan favoritism. Ms. Kane said the cases had been mismanaged and too weak to prosecute; local prosecutors later proved her wrong, winning convictions against four of the five officials.\n\nHer actions led to a feud with Frank G. Fina, a former top state prosecutor who had overseen the sting operation and the Sandusky case. Seeking to undercut Mr. Fina, Ms. Kane leaked to The Philadelphia Daily News information about a grand jury investigation he had been involved in \u2014 a leak that would lead to the criminal investigation of her actions.\n\nMs. Kane developed a reputation for trying to intimidate critics, and described herself as a victim of the entrenched boys\u2019 club she was threatening.\n\nErik Olsen, the chief of the criminal prosecution division in the attorney general\u2019s office, who was called Monday as a prosecution witness, described a campaign of \u201csystemic firings and Nixonian espionage.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe created a terror zone in this office,\u201d he said.\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the employment status of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State assistant football coach who was convicted of child molestation charges. He was retired at the time charges were filed; he was not an active coach.\n\nJon Hurdle reported from Norristown, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on October 25, 2016, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Ex-Pennsylvania Attorney General Is Sentenced to Prison in Perjury Case.

For example ask him, in the presence of Dara Gottfried, his wife of six years and the mother of their two children, how they first met or how he summoned the strength to ask for her phone number.\n\nIn response this loquacious comic lowered his gaze and began murmuring quietly.\n\n\u201cOpen up a little, Gil!\u201d said Ms. Gottfried, 43, an enthusiastic woman about the same height as her diminutive husband.\n\nTo the world Mr. Gottfried is known for his deliberately abrasive stage presence and seemingly bottomless vocabulary of vulgar words. (See his notorious performance of the dirtiest joke ever told in \u201cThe Aristocrats.\u201d)\n\nBut to Ms. Gottfried, who appears with him on Tuesday\u2019s episode of the ABC reality series \u201cCelebrity Wife Swap,\u201d he is her \u201cgentle genius\u201d: an endearing bundle of tics and peccadilloes who, despite a fundamental shyness, proves there really is someone for everyone.\n\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d never find anyone else like him,\u201d she said affectionately.\n\nTo which Mr. Gottfried added, \u201cMost people are hoping that they never find anyone like me.\u201d\n\nPutting on an exaggeratedly shrill voice Mr. Gottfried, a native New Yorker who is much calmer and more soft-spoken in person than onstage, has built a lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of stand-up shows, celebrity roasts and voice-over work (like playing the parrot Iago in Disney\u2019s \u201cAladdin\u201d movies).\n\nBut a wife and a family did not seem to be his destiny.

A lack of ease is something I find pleasant and interesting.\u201d\n\nThat changed in the late 1990s, when Ms. Gottfried, then Dara Kravitz and a music industry executive, met Mr. Gottfried at a Grammy Awards party at Tavern on the Green.\n\nShe said she had dropped food on a table, when \u201cGilbert picked it up and put it on his plate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked at him, like, \u2018Who is this guy?\u2019 \u201d she continued. \u201cHe looked sad and lost and childlike.

Jason Clarke, the star of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d worked the crowd, while Robert Zemeckis of \u201cFlight\u201d and Tom Hooper of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d got lost in the scrum.\n\nWhich raises a question: Are the big guys about to take back the Oscars?\n\nAfter watching indie films like \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d and \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d claim Hollywood\u2019s top honors for the last five years, the major studios are campaigning with a ferocity that could make one of them a winner on Feb. 24, Academy Awards night.\n\nAn unusually early Oscar nominating vote will begin on Dec. 17, with results to be announced on Jan. 10. And as the balloting approaches, every major studio has at least one film with a credible shot at the best picture award, which the last two years went to \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d both from an independent distributor, the Weinstein Company.\n\nTen days ago Universal Pictures \u2014 which has not had a best picture nominee since it split \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d with Weinstein in 2010 \u2014 introduced its star-laden musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway all sing) with about a dozen Friday and Saturday screenings in Los Angeles and New York. In both cities awards voters were greeted by Mr. Hooper, who won an Oscar in 2011 for directing \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d\n\nAs that was happening, Sony Pictures began a series of nearly 100 awards-oriented screenings in London and across the United States of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d another late-season entry that arrives with credentials that make it an instant contender. The film, about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, is directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal, who won Oscars in 2010 as the director and the writer of \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d\n\nAt the same time 20th Century Fox is in contention with \u201cLife of Pi\u201d from the director Ang Lee, another past Oscar winner (for directing \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d). DreamWorks and Walt Disney have \u201cLincoln,\u201d from Mr. Spielberg. Paramount Pictures is in the hunt with Mr. Zemeckis and \u201cFlight.\u201d\n\nAnd Warner Brothers has kept the heat under its early season entry, \u201cArgo,\u201d even as \u201cThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\u201d arrives from Peter Jackson, whose \u201cLord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d swept 11 Academy Awards in 2004, including best picture. \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d also continues to be a prospect for Warner. (Its director, Christopher Nolan, showed up on Saturday, joining the slugger\u2019s row of studio filmmakers.)\n\nWarner was the last major studio to release a best picture winner; that was \u201cThe Departed,\u201d from Martin Scorsese, which won the top Oscar and three others in 2007. Two years earlier Warner had had a winner with \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d; \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d released in the United States by Universal, took the prize in 2002. That followed a decade in which studio films like \u201cTitanic,\u201d from Fox and Paramount; \u201cForrest Gump\u201d and \u201cBraveheart,\u201d from Paramount; and \u201cUnforgiven,\u201d from Warner, all came up winners.\n\nThis year the studios\u2019 apparently strong position is partly a matter of focus. As the number of sophisticated films from the majors has dwindled, most studios have tended to concentrate their resources on one or two prestige pictures each year. While the studios are zeroing in, some formidable competitors from the independent world are spreading their energy among several pictures, none of which yet show any sign of dominating the race, as did, for instance, \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d from Fox Searchlight. (That indie darling won eight Oscars, including that for best picture, in 2009.)\n\nFox Searchlight, a specialty film division of Fox Film, is now backing \u201cThe Sessions,\u201d with Helen Hunt as a sex therapist treating a polio survivor played by John Hawkes; \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild,\u201d with its fable of life in a watery delta; and \u201cHitchcock,\u201d in which Anthony Hopkins portrays Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nFocus Features, a similar, smaller-film unit at Universal, had a movie from earlier in the year, Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cMoonrise Kingdom,\u201d that picked up five Independent Spirit awards nominations last week, including best feature, even as the company was continuing to campaign for later, prize-season releases like \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d and \u201cHyde Park on Hudson.\u201d\n\nAfter dominating the Oscars in the last two cycles the Weinstein Company and its master Oscar strategist, Harvey Weinstein, appear to be angling for advantage from, of all things, their underdog status. Inside the Weinstein camp last week \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d the studio\u2019s off-center romance starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and directed by David O. Russell, was being called \u201cthe little engine that could.\u201d\n\nThough it was reviewed almost as strongly as studio contenders including \u201cArgo\u201d and \u201cLincoln,\u201d Moviereviewintelligence.com reported, \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d lacks the kind of obvious hook that created media attention, and awards buzz, for \u201cThe Artist,\u201d which was nearly silent, or \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d about a stuttering British king.\n\nMr. Weinstein has yet to release \u201cDjango Unchained,\u201d a Christmas Day film from Quentin Tarantino (a past Oscar winner, for writing \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d), though awards screenings are promised shortly. And \u201cThe Master,\u201d from Paul Thomas Anderson (with five past nominations), could still shake the race if awards voters tend to agree more with the critics, who loved it, than with the audience, which has largely stayed away since the film\u2019s release in September.\n\nBut Mr. Weinstein and his small company are still in the thick of the fight. Both Mr. Cooper, of \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d and Amy Adams, of \u201cThe Master,\u201d made a show for the cameras, and Oscar voters, on Saturday night.\n\nMr. Tarantino, meanwhile, got face time by delivering a tribute to Mr. Needham, an 81-year-old sharecropper\u2019s son who described having broken more than 50 bones in the making of movies like \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and \u201cLittle Big Man\u201d and who broke down weeping on mentioning his mother.\n\nMr. Pennebaker, famous for documentaries like \u201cThe War Room\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back,\u201d kept speaking while the Governors Awards producers raised the lights up and down in what might have been a signal to cool it. He finally asked the guests if he was getting a bit long. Will Smith, at a front table, shouted \u201cNoooo!,\u201d so he kept going.\n\nJeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief executive, received the Jean Hersholt award for his philanthropic efforts and modestly acknowledged that his main contribution was getting other people to give.\n\nBut it was left to Mr. Stevens, the founder of the American Film Institute, to express what those glad-handing studio filmmakers hope is true.\n\n\u201cI have seen a couple of pictures this fall,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am confident will stand the test of time.\u201d", "summary": "The big studios hope to take top Oscars back from the independents, who have won major awards since 2008.", "compression": 70.1428571429, "coverage": 0.9047619048, "density": 1.2857142857, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

But according to the food and drug agency, the Red Cross has repeatedly failed to investigate the results of its mistakes, meaning there is no reliable record of whether recipients were harmed by the blood it collected.\n\nThe Red Cross, which controls 43 percent of the nation\u2019s blood supply, agrees that it has had quality-control problems and is working to fix them. Both its officials and the drug agency point out that none of the identified problems involve the most serious category of infractions. For instance, the Red Cross does a good job of testing for H.I.V. and hepatitis B, officials on all sides agree. And in general, Red Cross blood is regarded as some of the safest in the world.\n\nStill, the drug agency says, the problems that remain in screening donors and following protocols for collection add unnecessary risk to blood transfusions, almost five million of which were done in 2007, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical piece of the public health infrastructure,\u201d Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the drug agency, said in an interview. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult to get so many people trained and properly supervised, but it has to be done.\u201d\n\nThis week, the agency sent the Red Cross the results of yet another recent investigation that makes Ms. Malarkey\u2019s point: From December 2006 to April 2008, the Red Cross distributed more than 200 blood products that it had already identified as problematic, according to the investigation report.\n\nWhile many Americans see the Red Cross as the ubiquitous organization that responds to disasters big and small, its disaster-relief operation, which spends $400 million to $500 million annually, is small compared with its blood business, which generated $2.1 billion in revenue in the fiscal year that ended in June 2007.\n\nIn fact, the Red Cross is the world\u2019s largest single steward of blood, more than twice the size of the second-largest known blood collection operation. The rest of the world\u2019s blood supply is controlled by dozens of smaller organizations, only three of which have ever been under F.D.A.-requested consent decree.\n\nAfter years of quiet complaints about the Red Cross\u2019s blood business, the F.D.A. reluctantly decided to go public with its concerns in 1993, obtaining a consent decree that required the Red Cross to strengthen quality control and training and improve its ability to identify, investigate and record problems.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the hardest things I did as commissioner,\u201d said Dr. David A. Kessler, the F.D.A. commissioner from 1990 to 1997. Dr. Kessler said he had agonized that the move would cause undue alarm.\n\nThe news media, however, barely made note of it.\n\nFifteen years later, that consent decree, toughened in 2003 to allow the F.D.A. to impose fines for failing to properly identify, handle and report quality control problems, has produced only modest improvements, food and drug officials said.\n\n\u201cLeaving aside who\u2019s at fault here, it\u2019s not working,\u201d said Dr. Kessler, now a professor of pediatric medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cWhether it\u2019s that the American Red Cross just doesn\u2019t get it, whether it\u2019s that the relationship between the regulator and regulated is beyond the point of repair is immaterial. It\u2019s just not working.\u201d\n\nDr. Kessler said Congress should intervene at this point.\n\nDr. Bernadine Healy, the former chief executive of the Red Cross who made repairing the organization\u2019s blood operations a paramount goal, said the best solution might be to spin off the Red Cross\u2019s blood services.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the revenue base of the Red Cross is blood, yet the Red Cross is run by people who think of it as primarily a disaster-relief organization, relegating blood to stepchild status,\u201d Dr. Healy said. \u201cWhen is the last time you saw a Red Cross fund-raising appeal for money to make the blood supply safer or support its blood research?\u201d\n\nDr. Healy said she tried to start such a fund-raising program when she ran the Red Cross, but met internal resistance to it.\n\nThe Red Cross has toyed with selling off its blood operations, or otherwise decoupling them from its disaster work, but has never done so, in part because of a belief that the billions in revenue from blood has subsidized its disaster operations. But its financial systems are so antiquated that no one really knows.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that for sure because I can\u2019t find it out,\u201d said Kevin M. Brown, the Red Cross\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cI wish I could.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown noted, however, that the blood business was an integral part of the Red Cross. \u201cIt is consistent with our overall mission, which is saving lives,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving an ample and safe blood supply is critical to that mission.\u201d\n\nThe frustrations of dealing with the Red Cross are illustrated by the story of Michelle Hoyte, a whistle-blower who was first ignored, then dismissed.\n\nMs. Hoyte led a team of auditors who conducted a routine visit to the Red Cross blood services operation in Philadelphia in 2004. The team discovered that the facility, with the approval of a senior executive at the national headquarters in Washington, had decided not to recall some 600 units of blood collected using improper methods.\n\nSuch mistakes must be reported in writing to the F.D.A. within 15 days of detection, and the blood must be recalled. But Ms. Hoyte spent six months pleading with various supervisors to report the problem, first identified on Dec 18, 2003. Then she was fired.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that I thought it was the right thing for them to do; they are required to tell the F.D.A. under the terms of the consent decree,\u201d Ms. Hoyte, who worked for the F.D.A. before joining the Red Cross, said in an interview. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\n\nMs. Hoyte, who unsuccessfully sued the Red Cross for wrongful termination, had received \u201cexcellent performance appraisals,\u201d according to the lawsuit, and received a bonus and merit raise in the two years before her firing.\n\nThe Red Cross contends that her dismissal had nothing to do with her insistence on abiding by the court order. It said in court papers that she had been warned of shortcomings in her performance.\n\nThe Red Cross also defended its handling of the episode. \u201cThey followed the process and did what they should have done,\u201d said Eva Quinley, the senior vice president for quality and regulatory affairs at the Red Cross.\n\nBut the Red Cross did not recall the components produced from that blood until Feb. 23, 2005, 14 months after the problem was discovered, according to an F.D.A. report. By then, those components would have been used or discarded, and whether they caused any problems for patients is unknown.\n\nDetermining how often, if ever, blood supplied by the Red Cross has been responsible for serious health problems is difficult. F.D.A. documents rarely spell out the consequences of the failures they catalogue, a reflection, to some degree, of the agency\u2019s concern about alarming the public. But often they simply do not know. \u201cPatients who get blood transfusions tend to be pretty sick,\u201d Dr. Healy said. \u201cIf they spike a fever post-transfusion, no one is likely to suspect that the blood caused it.\u201d\n\nVarious records of F.D.A. inspections and correspondence with the Red Cross highlight poor follow-up, including falsified records.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2001, for example, a patient receiving blood bought from the Red Cross\u2019s greater Chesapeake and Potomac region, which serves the Washington area, died of hepatitis, according to an F.D.A. report. The agency concluded that the Red Cross had failed to perform a thorough investigation.\n\nFurthermore, the drug agency found that the Red Cross had failed to investigate 134 cases of suspected post-transfusion hepatitis that occurred across all its regions from January 2000 to June 2002.\n\nMs. Quinley said procedures had been changed since then in an effort to ensure that such cases would be investigated.\n\nUntil 1991, Red Cross blood operations were largely controlled by its regional chapters, which operated 53 blood centers in vastly different and often idiosyncratic ways. That year, Elizabeth Dole, then chief executive of the Red Cross, announced a sweeping overhaul that wrested control of the blood operations from the chapters and reorganized them into 10 regions, which were expected to adhere to a uniform set of standards and procedures.\n\nThat event is still referred to among many at the Red Cross as \u201cthe Divorce,\u201d a measure of the organization\u2019s entrenched culture.\n\nWhile Mrs. Dole won praise for taking a bold step to address a long history of sloppy testing and record keeping that raised concerns among regulators and the public about blood being potentially contaminated with H.I.V., chapters and their staff and volunteers saw it as an effort by the national headquarters to control the vast amount of money the blood services generate.\n\n\u201cWe have never truly moved away from independence to national, central standards,\u201d said J. Chris Hrouda, executive vice president and a 20-year veteran of the Red Cross\u2019s biomedical services, as the blood operations are known.\n\nNor did anyone anticipate the cost and difficulty of the reorganization, current and former executives said. At first the project was budgeted at $120 million, but the cost of developing a centralized database has run to at least $1 billion so far, according to estimates by former executives. The database would make it easier to track down flawed blood components and to flag donors who have been previously screened out because of diseases or travel to places where malaria is common.\n\n\u201cThere is no system to meet our needs,\u201d Mr. Hrouda said. \u201cWe are six times the size of the next-largest blood operations, and clearly that\u2019s a hindrance.\u201d\n\nA small company in Paris, Mak-System International Group, is working to create such a system, but Mr. Hrouda had no estimate of when it would be up and running.\n\nThus, the Red Cross\u2019s current blood operations, 36 regions grouped into seven divisions served by five testing laboratories, are still controlled by different systems that cannot easily \u201ctalk\u201d to one another.\n\nIn the meantime, the Red Cross has incorporated technology intended to help it prevent mistakes when blood is collected.\n\nThe most frequent errors cited by F.D.A. investigators involve failing to ask donors questions that would reveal their ineligibility to give blood. For instance, an interviewer forgets to ask a donor whether he has traveled in an area where malaria is a problem. So increasingly, donors fill out online questionnaires, which helps ensure that all required questions are answered.\n\nBlood collection is also error prone, governed as it is by strictly prescribed procedures. After phlebotomists locate a vein, they must scrub a 3-inch-by-3-inch area with antiseptic soap for 30 seconds, then use an antiseptic swab and, starting at the point where they will insert the needle, work outwards in concentric circles. They must then allow the area to dry for precisely 30 seconds before inserting the needle.\n\nTo improve that process, Red Cross phlebotomists recently began wearing electronic devices that time each of those steps.\n\nThe organization is also improving oversight on the mobile units used to collect roughly 80 percent of the blood it processes by assigning full-time supervisors.\n\nSuch measures, however, are undercut by high turnover among employees, who are paid little better than minimum wage, former executives say.\n\nMr. Hrouda said there was no plan to address high turnover. \u201cWe think we\u2019re able to recruit people at the wages we pay and are good at training them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe F.D.A., however, sees the main problem differently. \u201cSize is no longer an excuse,\u201d said Mr. Blumberg, the agency\u2019s deputy general counsel.\n\nMs. Malarkey, of the F.D.A.\u2019s Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality, said: \u201cRight now, the biggest issue confronting the Red Cross is what we refer to as their problem management. They have standard operating procedures by which they should be able to investigate, evaluate, correct and control to prevent recurrence of the issues we have identified again and again, but they have a lot of difficulty implementing those procedures and, frankly, in having people follow them.\u201d\n\nMs. Malarkey said a recent \u201cadverse determination letter,\u201d the process through which the F.D.A. informs the Red Cross of violations it has identified and demands payment of fines, illustrated her point.\n\nIn that letter, dated Feb. 8, the drug agency listed 113 \u201cevents\u201d involving 4,094 flawed blood components that were recalled by 15 of the Red Cross\u2019s 36 regions. The recalls occurred largely from April 15, 2003, to April 15, 2006. (It is not uncommon for letters to list hundreds of infractions \u2014 one 2005 letter identified more than 22,000 flawed blood components that were recalled \u2014 and recalls do not mean every blood product is returned.)\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing what we were seeing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, where unsuitable blood was routinely being released,\u201d Ms. Malarkey said, \u201cbut they still need to make more progress, and we would like to see that progress made quickly.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Despite Fines and Promises, Red Cross Falters With Blood.

The Obama administration is right to signal, in deliberately moderated ways, that Washington will not back off if Tehran ever attempts to carry it out.\n\nA show of American naval force kept the strait open to oil tankers during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. A Fifth Fleet spokeswoman usefully reminded Iran this week that the Navy always stands \u201cready to counter malevolent actions to ensure freedom of navigation.\u201d Oil markets reacted calmly, at least for now, with no price spikes.\n\nWhether or not Tehran is bluffing (or trying to drive up oil prices), Washington will not back down and Europe should not. More than five years after the United Nations Security Council ordered it to stop, Iran is still enriching uranium and mastering other technologies that would allow it to build a nuclear weapon. According to the latest report from United Nations inspectors, Iran has created computer models of nuclear explosions, conducted experiments on nuclear triggers and completed advanced research on a warhead that could be delivered by a medium-range missile.\n\nEighteen months have passed since the last round of Security Council sanctions. American calls to tighten the economic screws by, for example, concentrating on Iran\u2019s petrochemical industry have been stymied by Russia and China.

President Obama can limit the damage by making full use of a waiver, which allows him to block the penalties if they would threaten national security or cause oil prices to soar.\n\nEurope must also find the best way to increase pressure on Iran\u2019s government. We are not sure how a full-scale oil embargo would affect the global economy, but, before proceeding, the European Union should carefully weigh the consequences. Meanwhile, it should expand its list of targeted Iranian companies, officials and government entities. And both Europe and Washington should mount a new push on Russia and China to agree to toughened United Nations sanctions.\n\nTehran\u2019s latest threat to block global oil shipping should leave no doubt about its recklessness and its contempt for international law.

He had lot of time to think while hooked up to the machine, three times a week, as it pumped his blood out of his body, purified it and pumped it back in. Sometimes he found himself mulling over how odd it was that a new kidney \u2014 the one thing he needed most \u2014 was something money couldn\u2019t buy.\n\nWhen his kidneys first failed him, all sorts of people offered to donate one: his neighbor, his two 20-something nieces, two old friends, his sister. But none could follow through, mostly because of incompatible blood types. Such supply-and-demand mismatches can cause prices to skyrocket in a normal market, and indeed, Kim heard hints about the organ\u2019s economic value along the way. Once, at a backyard barbecue, a woman whispered to him that her mother purchased a kidney on the black market for $100,000.\n\nDespite the crushing demand, the sale of kidneys is banned in every country in the world except Iran. In the U.S., more than 100,000 people with renal failure are on the list for a deceased-donor kidney, typically waiting between four and five years. Last year, 4,270 people died waiting. Few but free-market absolutists would argue for repealing the 1984 law banning the organ trade in the U.S., but most would agree something should be done to increase the supply of kidneys for transplant. In a sense, though, there\u2019s already a global glut: While we are born with two kidneys, we can function just fine with one. The problem is that they\u2019re stuck inside of us.\n\nKim would have continued to wait on the national list, despite having several willing donors, were it not for a company called BiologicTx. Thanks to its software, Kim was able swap his sister\u2019s kidney for the Marine\u2019s kidney. The Marine, a woman named Liz Torres, gave up her kidney to ensure that her mother got a kidney, which came from a young social worker, Ana Tafolla Rios, who was a better match. Rios passed hers along to secure one for her ailing mother from Keith Rodriguez, a young man from Fresno. He let go of his to procure one for his mom, Norma, a 52-year-old dental assistant with polycystic kidney disease. All these people underwent surgery over two days in March at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, in what is called a kidney-transplant chain. The software programs driving such chains create something like a marketplace for organs \u2014 but one where supply and demand are balanced not through pricing but through altruism.\n\nA law-abiding American in need of a kidney has two options. The first is to wait on the national list for an organ donor to die in (or near) a hospital. The second is to find a person willing to donate a kidney to you. More than half the time, such donor-and-recipient pairs are incompatible, because of differences in blood type or the presence, in the donor\u2019s blood, of proteins that might trigger the recipient\u2019s immune system to reject the new kidney. The genius of the computer algorithms driving the kidney chains is that they find the best medical matches \u2014 thus increasing the odds of a successful transplant \u2014 by decoupling donors from their intended recipients. In the United States, half a dozen of these software programs allow for a kind of barter market for kidneys. This summer, doctors will most likely complete the last two operations in a record-breaking 70-person chain that involved flying donated kidneys on commercial airlines to several hospitals across the country.\n\nGaret Hil, the founder and chief executive of the National Kidney Registry, the largest kidney-chain exchange program in the world, has a background in financial services, not medicine. He borrowed concepts from the brokerage industry when developing the registry\u2019s algorithm. Hil founded the organization after the emotionally grueling experience of obtaining a kidney for his 10-year-old daughter. After seven family members, including Hil and his wife, volunteered to donate theirs, all seven were found to be a poor match. (Eventually they found a compatible cousin.)\n\nEach chain starts with a completely altruistic donor, someone who expects nothing in return. In the case of the San Francisco chain, that person was Zully Broussard, a 55-year-old mental-health nurse who works in a prison. Broussard lost her 21-year-old son to bone-cartilage cancer in 2001. Then, in 2013, her husband died of colon cancer. \u201cI know what it is to want an extra hour, an extra day, with someone you love,\u201d she told me. Directed by the algorithm, Broussard\u2019s kidney ended up inside a complete stranger, a 26-year-old factory worker, Oswaldo Padilla, with a 6-year-old daughter, setting off the 12-person chain that included Kim and his sister and ended with an interior designer named Verle Breschini.\n\nEconomists call an arrangement like this a matching market. \u201cIt is not fundamental to economic theory to assume people are selfish,\u201d Alvin E. Roth, an economist who teaches at Stanford University, told me. Roth won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2012 for his work using game theory to design matching markets, which pair unmatched things in mutually beneficial ways \u2014 students with public schools and doctors with hospitals. In such markets, money does not decide who gets what. Instead, these transactions are more akin to elaborate courtships.\n\nThe classic example of a matching market is the college-admissions process. Every year, tens of thousands of students apply to Harvard University. But just because a student wants a spot in the freshman class and can afford tuition does not mean he gets in. Harvard must also want him to attend. In the case of kidney exchange, this matchmaking happens at a microcellular level. White blood cells contain genetic markers, proteins that help our immune systems distinguish between our bodies and foreign invaders. The more closely a transplant recipient\u2019s genetic markers match a donor\u2019s, the more likely the body is to adopt that foreign kidney as its own rather than attacking it.\n\nAll these genetic variables mean that linking unrelated donors and recipients requires the kind of computational heft humans can\u2019t manage with pen and paper. For example, BiologicTx currently has 72 people in a computer database waiting to give or receive a kidney. Run the software to find biologically compatible matches among those 72 people, and you get 105,716 possible configurations \u2014 some long chains, others short. Some people in the database have no possible matches. Others, genetically blessed, have thousands of potential matching options within the pool. The software ranks those possible pairings based on hundreds of different immunological, genetic and demographic criteria, while also aiming to create longer chains of harder-to-match people which will ultimately result in more transplants.\n\nLast year in the United States, 544 kidneys were transplanted through these paired exchange programs, and many other countries are beginning to adopt them. Surgeons in Poland, Italy and Argentina completed their first chains last year. As more donor-and-recipient pairs enroll, the chains can accommodate increasingly complicated transactions. In December, for example, a transplant surgeon at U.C.L.A. removed the kidney from a grandfather who donated on behalf of his young grandson. The boy suffers from chronic kidney disease, but his doctors have determined he does not yet require a transplant. The grandfather feared that if he waited the five or 10 years until the boy needed the kidney, he would be too old to donate. So the boy and his grandfather joined the National Kidney Registry, using the grandfather\u2019s kidney to kick off a chain, thereby securing a kidney for the boy, who will be the last recipient in another chain at some unspecified future date.\n\nMark Kim had his operation two months ago, and ever since, people have been telling him that his voice seems different, that somehow he sounds more alive. And at a biological level, every cell in his body feels better. But that vitality extends beyond his physical well-being. He is now one link in a visceral chain of sacrifice and benefit. It feels, to him, a little bit like kinship.\n\nMalia Wollan is a frequent contributor to The New York Times and the Tip columnist for the magazine.

He loves us!\u201d brother Boon (Peter Riegert) cheers as the soused frat members later crash a predominantly black bar to catch a set by their favorite band, only to realize that they are the only white kids there and that Otis has no idea who they are.\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT \u201cWhaddaya got in here, rocks?\u201d an exhausted caddy asks Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s vulgar Al Czervik after setting down his massive golf bag. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Czervik replies. \u201cWhen I was your age I would lug 50 pounds of ice up five, six flights of stairs.\u201d \u201cSo what?\u201d the caddy asks, unimpressed. \u201cSo what?\u2019 So let\u2019s dance!\u201d Cue: Journey\u2019s \u201cAny Way You Want It.\u201d The bag is wired for sound and immediately ruins the day for Judge Smails (Ted Knight).\n\nLASTING WISDOM, COURTESY OF JUDGE SMAILS If you can\u2019t afford college, \u201cthe world needs ditch diggers, too.\u201d\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT While pink Oxford shirts, tighty-whities and sweat socks remain popular when unwinding, movies don\u2019t really have single scenes that turn working actors into stars anymore. This is one of them. Mom and Dad are gone. Joel, a high school senior anxious about getting into Princeton, has the shiny suburban home and expensive stereo to himself, and he\u2019s not wearing pants.

Simpson was considered for the part of the cyborg.\n\nDIRECTORS Peter and Bobby Farrelly\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT As if persuading the cult singer-songwriter Jonathan Richman to appear as a kind of one-man, strumming Greek chorus were not enough, this romantic comedy ends with an inexplicable but charming rendition of the Foundations\u2019 1968 bubble-gum chart-topper \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup,\u201d lip-synced by Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott, Sarah Silverman, Brett Favre and a bunch of orange-jumpsuited prisoners.\n\nFUN FACT Mr. Favre, whose surname is garbled by Mr. Stiller\u2019s character, was the third choice for the part of Ms. Diaz\u2019s pro footballer beau, after the relatively easy to pronounce Drew Bledsoe and Steve Young. Mr. Bledsoe had an off-the-gridiron injury, and Mr. Young apparently bowed out because of the subject matter.\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT The credit sequence alone probably cost as much as several indie hits that year combined. After a faux Spielberg movie (\u201cAustinpussy\u201d), there\u2019s still another three minutes for Mike Myers, as the title spy, to mug and shimmy through an elaborately choreographed \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d tribute (\u201cThis is where the movie gets its mojo, baby\u201d) and end up in an oddly modern Britney Spears video for her single \u201cBoys\u201d as her breasts fire bullets and her head explodes.\n\nFUN FACT You wouldn\u2019t know it from the first six minutes of spectacle, but Beyonc\u00e9 is also in this movie, as Foxxy Cleopatra.\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT Steve Carell\u2019s titular middle-aged virgin finally loses it. In the \u201970s, he would have been in bed with Catherine Keener, smoked a cigarette and discussed the nature of life and love, but given that this is an anything-goes farce, he treats us to a between-the-sheets version of the \u201960s anthem \u201cThe Age of Aquarius,\u201d and suddenly we are in a green field with colorful gauze flags and a shirtless Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd.\n\nSAD FACT The film was stripped of the popular assurance that no animals were harmed during filming, after an off-camera accident involving an aquarium prop killed some tropical fish.\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s Tom has been courting Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Summer for quite a nonlinear while when he emerges from her apartment with a blocklong smile on his face and the Hall & Oates tune \u201cYou Make My Dreams Come True\u201d on the soundtrack as pedestrians turn into dance partners. She may prove to be a man-eater, but for the time being, her kiss is all over his list.\n\nFUN FACT The film was produced by, among others, Mark Waters, who, along with his brother, Daniel, is responsible for some of the most quotable teenage films of the last 30 years. He directed \u201cMean Girls\u201d (2004), and Daniel wrote the \u201cHeathers\u201d screenplay.\n\nMUSICAL MOMENT \u201cFor good times, and bad times, I\u2019ll be on your side forever more.\u201d That may be what friends are for, but Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne, competing for maximum toast time at a bridal shower for Maya Rudolph\u2019s character, are anything but amicable. This song, best known for its 1985 release for an AIDS research charity, was written by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager with zero irony, which is why instilling it with rancor is the stuff of summer comedy myth.\n\nFUN FACT Rebel Wilson, a breakout star of the movie, also appeared in the next year\u2019s \u201cBachelorette,\u201d another raunchy ensemble film set before a wedding.

Lately, I have come to think that this is more true than I had imagined.\n\nMost mornings in warm weather, when I am home in coastal Connecticut, I head out before dawn to row on a 260-acre dogleg of a lake, backed up behind a rickety old dam. And I see plenty of wonderful things as I do my laps: An osprey cruising with a freshly caught fish carried underneath, like a seaplane pontoon. A newly emerged damselfly riding on my deck for a lap and a half till its wings harden enough for flight. And once, at a distance of 50 feet, a bald eagle scavenging the carcass of a cormorant. But I did not realize until recently that a grand evolutionary experiment was taking place beneath my hull.\n\nAlong with other members of my rowing club, the Blood Street Sculls, I spent much of last summer moaning about a project to rebuild the dam where Rogers Lake here spills down to become Mill Brook, on route to Long Island Sound and the sea. Construction required dropping the lake level by more than two feet, and that increased the risk for rowers of scraping the bottom or spilling ignominiously on an unexpectedly low patch.\n\nNow, though, the dam is finished, and starting this month, alewives, also known as river herring, are climbing the new fish ladder around the dam so they can return to Rogers Lake from their feeding grounds at sea. The work is part of a coastwide effort to remove or bypass dams in the hope of restoring the alewives to their former glory.\n\nAlewives are anadromous fish: Born in freshwater, they spend their lives in the ocean, returning annually to their birthplaces to spawn. Until colonial-era dams cut off their migration, hundreds of thousands of alewives would have come pouring into Rogers Lake every spring \u2014 and into other lakes like it along much of the Eastern Seaboard. Farmers used to apply them to their fields as fertilizer, and all along the coast, river herring festivals celebrated their arrival.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly intriguing about Rogers Lake, though, is that the first dam built on Mill Brook in 1672 inadvertently drew a pre-Darwinian dividing line across the species. On one side of the dam, the anadromous alewives continued their old seagoing life. But on the other side, in Rogers Lake, other members of the species became landlocked.\n\nOver the past 17 years, local conservationists have added fish ladders to the dams lower down on Mill Brook, and about 10,000 anadromous alewives a year have been recovering at least a part of their old migration. The new fish ladder means they can finally complete their journey \u2014 and come face to face with their landlocked cousins, after a separation of 342 years.\n\nEvolution has wrought strange changes in the intervening 100 or so generations, most notably in size. The landlocked fish are now just a third the length of their foot-long seagoing cousins. Somewhere beneath the hull of my rowing shell, it\u2019s as if mastiffs are returning to discover that their distant kinfolk and potential mates have become Chihuahuas.\n\nAT his laboratory at Yale University, the ecologist David Post clambered over obstacles in what would be a walk-in freezer, if it weren\u2019t so full, and eventually pulled out plastic bags containing frozen landlocked and anadromous alewives. \u201cThey look like something you\u2019d get out of a pickled herring jar, because that\u2019s basically what they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not nearly as sexy as Atlantic salmon, or as funky as eels. They\u2019re silvery and nondescript, and that\u2019s both the joy and the curse of working with these fish.\u201d\n\nThe joy, for an ecologist, is that alewives are a keystone species. As predators, they drive the ecosystem of every coastal lake and stream from the Carolinas to Maine \u2014 or at least the ones to which they can still gain access. As prey, alewives, together with menhaden, Atlantic herring and other forage fish, are the basic food stock for the entire Atlantic fishery, as well as for seabirds, whales, dolphins and other species.\n\nPart of the curse is that even biologists have a hard time telling alewives from bluebacks, another species of river herring. At sea, alewives, bluebacks and Atlantic herring all school together, and to fishermen trawling huge nets for the Atlantic herring, they also look the same. As a result, an estimated 3.8 million river herring a year are caught unintentionally as bycatch, and that may be an important reason the overall river herring population has plummeted by more than half since the 1960s.\n\nProfessor Post has been studying alewives in Connecticut lakes for the past decade and is now tracking the outcome of the reunion at Rogers Lake. Before the dams cut them off, he said, the alewives arrived each spring as \u201cslash and burn\u201d predators on the planktonic life in the lake. They picked off everything they could find \u2014 mostly fly larvae and feathery little copepods and water fleas \u2014 and then headed back out again, leaving what was left of the plankton to recover for another harvest the following spring. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good lifestyle, if you\u2019re anadromous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou eat everything in sight and go elsewhere.\u201d\n\nBut once the alewives became landlocked, they caused an almost complete disappearance of large plankton. The change in the prey base forced the alewives not just to become significantly smaller but also to develop more closely spaced gill rakers, apparently so they could strain their minuscule food from the water rather than picking it off one particle at a time.\n\nSo what will happen when the two forms of alewife come together? Size may not matter for mating, since alewives don\u2019t practice internal fertilization. Instead, they broadcast sperm and eggs into the water simultaneously. But the anadromous alewives begin breeding several weeks ahead of their landlocked cousins. So the two forms may just pass one another with a glance, curious but puzzled.\n\nOr there may just be enough overlap for romance. If so, what happens to the young? Will they turn seaward at the end of the summer, as did their anadromous forebears? Or will the landlocked lifestyle keep its hold on them?\n\nIt is an evolutionary family drama, and it makes me think that Thoreau was right: With every stroke of my oars, I am skimming across the surface of unsuspected mysteries.\n\nRichard Conniff is the author of \u201cThe Species Seekers: Heroes, Fools, and the Mad Pursuit of Life on Earth.\u201d\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on April 21, 2014, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: An Evolutionary Family Drama.

It is the responsibility of leaders on both sides to try and calm the volatile emotions that once again threaten both peoples.\n\nThe hostilities and recriminations began with the kidnapping and murder last month of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank: Eyal Yifrach, 19; Naftali Fraenkel, 16; and Gilad Shaar, 16. Last week, the body of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, a Palestinian teenager, was found beaten and burned in a forest.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, after days of near silence, condemned that killing and promised that anyone found guilty would \u201cface the full weight of the law.\u201d Israeli officials said the murder seemed to be a revenge attack for the killing of the three Israeli teenagers. In the sweep to find those teenagers, six Palestinians were killed in confrontations with Israeli forces and about 400 Palestinians were arrested, many of them affiliated with Hamas, which Israel accused of the murders. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, also after a delay, denounced the abductions and vowed to help catch the kidnappers. Two suspects said to have ties to Hamas have since been arrested.\n\nAfter the attack on the Israeli teenagers, some Israelis gave in to their worst prejudices. During funerals for the boys, hundreds of extreme right-wing protesters blocked roads in Jerusalem chanting \u201cDeath to Arabs.\u201d A Facebook page named \u201cPeople of Israel Demand Revenge\u201d gathered 35,000 \u201clikes\u201d before being taken down; a blogger gave prominence to a photo, also on Facebook, that featured a sign saying: \u201cHating Arabs is not racism, it\u2019s values.\u201d Even Mr. Netanyahu referenced an Israeli poem that reads: \u201cVengeance for the blood of a small child, Satan has not yet created.\u201d Israelis have long had to cope with Hamas\u2019s violence, including a recent increase in rocket attacks from Gaza. And Palestinians have been fully guilty of hateful speech against Jews.\n\nIn an atmosphere in which each side dehumanizes the other, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that some people would act on extremist views. According to news reports, the suspects arrested in Mr. Khdeir\u2019s murder may be fans of a soccer club known for its anti-Arab rhetoric. Commentators in the Israeli news media have been frank in analyzing the killings, especially that of Mr. Khdeir, and their effect on society. Self-criticism is a strength of democracies. An editorial in Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, said prosecuting Mr. Khdeir\u2019s murderers is not by itself sufficient. The country\u2019s leaders \u201cmust begin raising the next generation, at least, on humanist values, and foster a tolerant public discourse.\u201d\n\nDespite the pain and anger, there have been gestures of compassion and understanding. Mr. Khdeir\u2019s grieving father made an appeal for \u201cboth sides to stop the bloodshed.\u201d On Sunday, the uncle of Naftali Fraenkel offered his condolences in a phone call with Mr. Khdeir\u2019s father.

Auden, I suspect, would have admired \u201cFebruary House,\u201d which begins previews Tuesday at the Public Theater, and not just because this snippet of his poem \u201cRefugee Blues,\u201d sung by its young cast, seems to set the play\u2019s emotional tone:\n\nSay this city has 10 million souls,\n\nSome are living in mansions, some are living in holes:\n\nYet there\u2019s no place for us, my dear,\n\nYet there\u2019s no place for us.\n\nBased on actual events, \u201cFebruary House\u201d is about the serendipitous discovery, amid New York\u2019s crush of souls, of an almost perfect place. In this case that means a dilapidated house in Brooklyn Heights that became, in the early 1940s, a bohemian commune of sorts for intellectual misfits that included Auden, the novelist Carson McCullers, who was 23, and the composer Benjamin Britten, then 27.\n\nThe burlesque entertainer and aspiring writer Gypsy Rose Lee, then 29, also crammed herself into the house on 7 Middagh Street. Stirring Lee into this imposing bunch reminds you of something once said about Pauline Kael and The New Yorker magazine: She gave it sex, and it gave her class.\n\nThis group home was the brainchild of a fiction editor and bon vivant named George Davis, then 34, who acted as papa bear, therapist and swizzle stick. It was a utopian experiment like Brook Farm, the transcendentalist commune in 19th-century Massachusetts. Thankfully, as Auden declares in the play, it was Brook Farm \u201cwithout the vegetarians.\u201d\n\n\u201cFebruary House\u201d is based more specifically on a nonfiction book of the same name by Sherill Tippins that was published in 2005.\n\nThe gifted young composer Gabriel Kahane was commissioned by the Public Theater to write the play\u2019s music and lyrics. The book is by Mr. Kahane\u2019s former Brown University classmate Seth Bockley. They\u2019re an imposing team.\n\n\u201cThe mistake we didn\u2019t want to make,\u201d Mr. Bockley told me recently, \u201cwas to simply deliver a history lesson, an eat-your-vegetables vehicle about famous people. We wanted a genuine theatrical experience, with characters who have obstacles and argue and fall complicatedly in love.\u201d\n\nI saw an early workshop of \u201cFebruary House\u201d last July at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. \u2014 a lively evening, and not just because Natalie Merchant, who was in the audience, opened a door for me when I sneaked out at intermission for a cigarette. (The show later had a well-received run at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.)\n\nSparks fly early and often. When Auden pretentiously blurts to McCullers that \u201cI am a thinking-sensation artist in the Jungian sense, whereas you are clearly a feeling-intuitive type,\u201d she takes out a flask, eyeballs him as if were a space alien, and says: \u201cUh huh. Gin?\u201d\n\nAuden seemed to enjoy McCullers\u2019s impudence. He is, after all, the man who said, \u201cAmong those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.\u201d\n\nAuden and McCullers are a pure and defiant literary odd couple. Both stoke your imagination in \u201cFebruary House,\u201d in part because of their youth, in part because both wrestle with where their obligations to art end and their obligations to politics begin. They are increasingly obsessed with what Lionel Trilling, in \u201cThe Liberal Imagination,\u201d called \u201cthe dark and bloody crossroads where literature and politics meet.\u201d\n\nThe play takes place during the early days of World War II, and a sense of doom lingers in the air. A radio broadcasts reports of the bombing of London, where some writers and intellectuals criticized Auden for remaining safe and utterly unbombed in America. Auden declares early in the musical: \u201cOne\u2019s life and private conduct are the most important political statements one can make.\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Kahane\u2019s music and lyrics move from mournful to antic. Gypsy Rose Lee emerges in a fur coat in one scene, and she sings: \u201cIf you want to get my hair in a tousle/Talk to me about Bertrand Russell.\u201d Davis was helping her write what would become her best-selling thriller, \u201cThe G-String Murders.\u201d\n\nThe emotional heart of \u201cFebruary House\u201d shifts with its scenes and moods, but it often seems to reside in the McCullers character. The waiflike Georgia-born writer was already the author of a well-received novel, \u201cThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.\u201d\n\nThat novel included these plaintive lines, which seem to speak to her experience in Brooklyn: \u201cSome kind of music was too private to sing in a house cram full of people. It was funny, too, how lonesome a person could be in a crowded house.\u201d\n\nEstranged from her husband and already drinking too much, McCullers may have had a sexual relationship with another of the house\u2019s residents, Erika Mann, a 34-year-old refugee intellectual and cabaret performer from Germany.\n\nMcCullers is portrayed in the Public Theater\u2019s production by the actress Kristen Sieh. In addition to poring over McCullers\u2019s fiction, and attending to biographies, Ms. Sieh has worked diligently on perfecting McCullers\u2019s accent.\n\nHer \u201cvoice was a strange and beautiful sound of the old South,\u201d Ms. Sieh told me, \u201ca type of voice that has nearly vanished. I listen to recordings of her speaking whenever I can. And luckily for me, this play\u2019s director, Davis McCallum, is from Georgia, as is my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nPart of capturing McCullers onstage is nailing her youthful awkwardness; she thought of herself as a blunderbuss and a bit of a klutz. \u201cWhen people talk about McCullers,\u201d Ms. Sieh said, \u201cthey often recall how she was always sitting in odd positions. I do a lot of unusual sitting in this play.\u201d\n\nThe house in Brooklyn Heights was called February House \u2014 by Ana\u00efs Nin, who dropped in \u2014 because so many of its residents had birthdays that month. Other than that, however, they seem to have had little in common except a commitment to their art and to not ever being bored. Cocaine is snorted in \u201cFebruary House\u201d; bedbugs are extravagantly shuddered over; a good deal of whiskey is poured.\n\nIt is impossible, alas, to visit the actual 7 Middagh Street. The house was demolished to make way for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Auden may have disapproved of such a pilgrimage anyway. As he put it, \u201cArt is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.\u201d", "summary": "In the new musical \u00e2\u0080\u009cFebruary House,\u00e2\u0080\u009d W. H.

The following segments are based on those comments and follow-up interviews. They have been condensed and edited.\n\nPlease add your own views by leaving a comment. Tell us how you wrestle with this debate, and how, if at all, the attacks in Paris changed your views. Please include where you live and information on your background or life experiences that may have influenced your opinion.\n\nRajeev Achari, 53 \u2014 A physician who was raised in Calcutta and lives in Phoenix. He was working as an emergency room doctor in Brooklyn on Sept. 11, 2001. He now identifies as an atheist.\n\nThe greatest terrorist threat to European and American cities comes from radicalized Muslim citizens. The Islamic State needs to be defeated in time, but the major effort needs to be in intelligence gathering. The French and Belgian intelligence organizations seem to have been caught with their pants down. A much more robust monitoring of mosques, Muslim community centers and donor networks is needed. If this requires suspension of civil liberties, that bitter pill needs to be swallowed.\n\nI have formed my views on religion and especially on religious fundamentalists a lot by what happened on 9/11. Now that this happened in Paris, the feeling of a sense of shock is repeated. This kind of brings back those memories. You feel anew the feelings of loss, of sadness.\n\nRoger Schwarz, 65 \u2014 A criminal lawyer in New York City. His grandmother was killed at Auschwitz during World War II, and the rest of his family had to leave Germany and emigrate to the United States.\n\nAs a lawyer, I suggest that amending or abrogating a constitution in the name of fighting terrorism is one of the greatest threats to a free society \u2014 almost as great as terrorism itself. When we permit greater government intrusion into our privacy, broader searches and fewer procedural safeguards, we travel on a short road to tyranny.\n\nElected representatives lack the courage and fortitude to live up to their oaths to preserve and protect the constitution and offer only shortsighted, get-tough rhetoric to fan the flames of fear. This is the greatest toll that the terrorists exact on all of us.\n\nWe know from past history, like in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, what happens when you suspend the constitution \u2014 the tremendous threat that poses to the entire country in the longer term.\n\nI think the framers drafted the Constitution with great wisdom, and I think there is always a risk at times like this when people are fearful. It is exactly when we have to be most vigilant about protecting and defending the Constitution.\n\n\u201cLilou\u201d \u2014 An American from Santa Monica, Calif., who comments under that name. She lives in Paris, where she teaches English. She lives about five miles from the Bataclan concert hall, where 89 people were killed. She said that she was in California on Sept. 11, and she didn\u2019t feel the same sadness and anger as she did after the attacks in Paris.\n\nMy beliefs have moved toward the right since Friday. I think having something in your own backyard makes a difference.\n\nI do believe the Islamic State, or Daesh, has been an insidious enemy all along, and have written that they should be stopped. But I never, until now, advocated the very unpolitically correct view of military retaliation (versus negotiation).\n\nI was very satisfied when France sent their jets. The vengeance felt very good to me. The idea of killing innocent civilians has never appealed to me. It is very bizarre for me to suddenly, after the events in Paris Friday night, be happy that someone went and bombed Syria. I know that civilians died, so within my happiness is some guilt. But I am not unhappy that we took a measure against Syria and actually Daesh.\n\nWhile I preferred the Middle Eastern immigrant surge be limited to just those fleeing for their lives, based on cost and quality-of-life reasons, now there are such numbers of immigrants flowing through to Germany, that there is not enough border patrol staff to process their asylum applications.\n\nAfter a Syrian passport was found with one of the suicide bombers at the Stade de France, it made me change my mind about the refugees. I have Muslim friends and clients who are not extremist, and I did not take seriously that the refugees could harbor jihadists. I was wrong.\n\nAs to deportation or house arrest of suspected terrorists, I have developed another very politically incorrect point of view, that is, selectively monitoring suspected terrorists \u2014 not everyone. Each country has a list of suspects, which I now believe should be acted on.\n\nGhulam Faruki, 81 \u2014 A retired psychiatrist from Ahmedabad, India, who lives in Queensbury, N.Y. He emigrated to the United States in 1964 for its better working conditions, employment opportunities and lack of discrimination against Muslims. \u201cIn 1964 there was no anti-Muslim discrimination in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201c9/11 did change a lot of things.\u201d\n\nLet us not blame European Muslims for what are essentially failures of French intelligence.\n\nI do not mean to criticize or blame French intelligence. It is just a fact that the intelligence failed.\n\nWhen this incident occurred, the Muslim community has to go through a lot related to how are we are looked upon. People are criticizing us, people are blaming us. The Muslim community, both in the United States and in Europe, has to go through a period of stress because these things happen \u2014 which is not their fault at all.\n\nValerie Natale, 50 \u2014 A biomedical scientist who lives in Santa Clara, Calif., and has a degree in history.\n\nBetter, focused intelligence is what we need, not wholesale spying on everyone from Joe the Plumber to Angela Merkel. We need to focus our attention on the actual enemies, not the imagined ones like ordinary Americans, allies, and even Saddam Hussein. The lies, the overly broad wiretapping, and the wars in the wrong places have all helped get us where we are.\n\nWhat we need to do now is to assess our mistakes honestly so as to avoid making them again and again, so as to find a way out of this mess. Bomb a city, and you create a recruiting drive. Target the leaders, and you do everyone a favor.\n\nI try to react using logic and rational thought rather than emotions. I understand it \u2014 you get hurt and you want to lash out. It is O.K. to feel that way, but I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to then go act on those feelings.\n\n\u201cVieillemontagne,\u201d 50 \u2014 A Frenchman living in Britain who comments under that handle. He criticized the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, for his handling of the terrorism threat.\n\nThe hard questions for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande are going to be: Why didn\u2019t he take some of these initiatives at the beginning of the year, after the terrorist attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo? Why didn\u2019t he take them when it became clear, a few months ago, as he now says, that some big terrorist attacks were being prepared?\n\nWe have to continue to live, but to do this, we have to be convinced that governments have their act together and that there are no inefficiencies.\n\n\u201cGMR,\u201d 62 \u2014 A paralegal living in Atlanta who comments under those initials.\n\nRather than taking away freedoms from the overwhelmingly compliant masses of citizens, why don\u2019t we focus on the noncompliant minority, for example those who travel to Syria for radicalization. And in an emergency state, which France is declared to be in, we should revoke their French citizenship when they leave for one of those countries without prior approval from the government.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is unreasonable to ask citizens who seek to travel to war-torn countries for personal reasons to justify such reasons in advance. If one doesn\u2019t have evil intentions, this should not be a problem.\n\nI believe the foremost job of a national government is to protect its citizens. The good of the many must outweigh the personal freedom of the few to advance their religious or other personal agenda when those few are seeking to do harm to fellow citizens.\n\nA few freedoms of expression or personal freedoms might have to be suspended in an interim period when there are grave things going on. It is for the common good in an extreme situation.\n\nPlease join this debate by sharing your views in the comments.

On Page 126, a caption in a section about immigration referred to Africans brought to American plantations between the 1500s and 1800s as \u201cworkers\u201d rather than slaves.\n\nHe reached for his cellphone and sent a photograph of the caption to his mother, Roni Dean-Burren, along with a text message: \u201cwe was real hard workers, wasn\u2019t we.\u201d\n\nTheir outrage over the textbook\u2019s handling of the nation\u2019s history of African-American slavery \u2014 another page referred to Europeans coming to America as \u201cindentured servants\u201d but did not describe Africans the same way \u2014 touched off a social-media storm that led the book\u2019s publisher, McGraw-Hill Education, to vow to change the wording and the school\u2019s teachers to use other materials in the class.\n\n\u201cIt talked about the U.S.A. being a country of immigration, but mentioning the slave trade in terms of immigration was just off,\u201d said Ms. Dean-Burren, who is black. \u201cIt\u2019s that nuance of language. This is what erasure looks like.\u201d\n\nMs. Dean-Burren cataloged her objections to the caption last week in posts on Facebook and Twitter. The posts, along with a video she made while flipping through the book, were widely shared, catching the attention of the #blacklivesmatter movement as the video alone reached nearly two million views.\n\nTexas textbooks \u2014 and how they address aspects of history, science, politics and other subjects \u2014 have been a source of controversy for years in part because the state is one of the largest buyers of textbooks. In 2010, the Texas Board of Education approved a social-studies curriculum that put a conservative stamp on history and economics textbooks, including emphasizing Republican political achievements and movements. State-sanctioned textbooks have been criticized for passages suggesting Moses influenced the writing of the Constitution and dismissing the history of the separation of church and state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no accident that this happened in Texas,\u201d said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, a group that has criticized the content of state-approved textbooks. \u201cWe have a textbook adoption process that\u2019s so politicized and so flawed that it\u2019s become almost a punch line for comedians.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the Texas Education Agency did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe World Geography textbook was used by Coby, a student at Pearland High School in Pearland, Tex., a city of 100,000 about 20 miles south of downtown Houston. In a section of the book describing America as a nation of immigrants and called \u201cPatterns of Immigration,\u201d the text with a map of the United States reads: \u201cThe Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations.\u201d The authors, on the page next to the map, wrote of \u201can influx of English and other European peoples, many of whom came as indentured servants to work for little or no pay,\u201d but made no mention of how Africans came to the country.\n\nAfter Ms. Dean-Burren\u2019s social-media posts, McGraw-Hill Education said in a statement posted on its Facebook page Friday that it would change the caption in the digital and print versions of the book to describe the arrival of African slaves in the United States as \u201ca forced migration.\u201d\n\nIn a memo sent to employees, David Levin, the president and chief executive of McGraw-Hill Education, issued an apology, calling the caption \u201ca mistake\u201d and saying the company was reviewing its internal procedures and increasing its list of textbook reviewers to reflect greater diversity.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply sorry that the caption was written this way,\u201d Mr. Levin wrote to employees. \u201cWhile the book was reviewed by many people inside and outside the company, and was made available for public review, no one raised concerns about the caption. Yet, clearly, something went wrong, and we must and will do better.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Levin said the textbook, which spans more than 800 pages, does not sugarcoat the issue of slavery and includes more than a dozen references to the capture and enslavement of Africans. He said the caption was written in 2012 and had been posted, along with the rest of the book\u2019s content, on a Texas website as part of the state textbook adoption process for almost a year. No objections to the caption were raised, he said.\n\nThere were more than 100,000 copies of the textbook in the hands of Texas school districts. Mr. Levin said the company was in touch with districts and was offering to replace the textbook, provide a sticker with the rewritten caption to cover up the old one or supply a lesson plan free of charge to teachers on cultural sensitivity \u201cto create an opportunity for a richer dialogue.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pearland Independent School District said high school social-studies teachers would not use the textbook when teaching that part of the class until the publisher made the updates. The teachers will use \u201cdifferent resources in teaching that content\u201d in the meantime, said the spokeswoman, Kim Hocott.\n\nAt Pearland High School, nearly 800 students use the World Geography textbook, the latest edition of which was put into use this school year. In addition to the online versions of the textbook the students used, there were 244 print-edition sets at the school, said Ms. Hocott, who suggested that it was the teachers and not the textbook that guided the instruction in the classroom.\n\n\u201cIn Pearland I.S.D., textbooks are used as a resource and do not drive the curriculum,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that our teachers serve as the primary resource for information on the curriculum in which they teach.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear how many other districts planned to respond to the problem with the caption. At one district in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas called the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo I.S.D., a spokeswoman said that students there used the textbook, but that the section with the caption was not part of its curriculum.\n\nMs. Dean-Burren, a former English teacher at Pearland High who is pursuing her doctoral degree in education at the University of Houston, said her son had told that her he chuckled to himself after he read the caption last Wednesday, but did not bring it to the attention of his teacher.\n\nThe teacher had not yet lectured on the chapter, she said. In the video she posted online, she pointed out the sections of the textbook that listed the many academic consultants, teacher reviewers and members of a state advisory board who approved the book.\n\n\u201cThese are all people, all professionals, who said \u2018yes\u2019 to this book,\u201d she said in the video.\n\nManny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Christine Hauser from New York.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on October 6, 2015, on page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy.

The temperature in Central Park for Monday dipped to 3 degrees. That temperature missed the date\u2019s record low of 1 degree, set on Feb. 16, 1888. The city still felt wind chills below minus-10 degrees.\n\nBut Mr. Roufs, 61, who considers 20 degrees \u201cpretty warm,\u201d is not gloating. \u201cOh no, oh no, I often thought about being up there. It\u2019s got to be really tough for the maintenance people. It\u2019s just got to be a mess,\u201d he said sympathetically, musing aloud on the difficulty of hauling snow away in big cities. \u201cThat must just be terrible.\u201d\n\nWhy, yes, New Yorkers would agree. It was. It is. And it will continue to be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s just crazy. I look at the weather; the whole week is going to be freezing. And we\u2019re supposed to be putting up with this?\u201d said Vernaline McFarlane, 46, one of a group of tenants in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who sued their landlord over his failure to provide heat to their building more than a year ago, but say they still suffer through frigid days and nights. \u201cYou come in and it\u2019s cold, cold, cold,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got two sheets on the bed and a comforter; I\u2019m going to just bundle up and stay in my bedroom.\u201d\n\nBy 2 p.m. on Sunday, the city had logged 1,283 heat and hot water complaints through 311 calls, a significant increase over the average of 750 on a winter Sunday, according to city officials. As on other dangerously cold days, homeless outreach workers were out on Sunday to try to bring homeless people indoors.\n\nThe Coney Island Polar Bear Club, whose members swim in the Atlantic Ocean off Coney Island every Sunday from November through April, had about a dozen or two fewer participants than usual, said Dennis Thomas, the club\u2019s president. In a bow to the elements, however, those who showed up logged only five minutes in the water, half the usual amount of time.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the water, you have to give yourself enough time to walk back to the boardwalk. You have to plan for that on a day like today, because there was the wind and the sand blowing,\u201d Mr. Thomas said, conceding that the experience \u201cwas painful.\u201d\n\nFor the less valiant, indoors was much preferred \u2014 even if indoors was inside the entirely ice-covered chamber of Minus5, a bar in Midtown Manhattan where the benches are made of ice, the cups are made of ice, the guests swaddle themselves in identical blue parkas and the atmosphere is 23 degrees and neon-lit year round.\n\nAmong the bar\u2019s patrons on Sunday afternoon was Philip Pun, 30. \u201cThat torture isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Mr. Pun said, waving at Sixth Avenue.\n\nNot to burst Mr. Pun\u2019s snowball, but it quickly emerged that inside the bar, lacking wind, was actually warmer than outside.\n\nThe bar\u2019s busiest months are December and January, said Dilruba Eva Sultana, the receptionist, and Valentine\u2019s Day drew a line of couples that stretched out the door.\n\n\u201cIn wintertime, people already have their coats and boots,\u201d Ms. Sultana said. \u201cThey\u2019re already geared up.\u201d\n\nAt Kennedy International Airport on Sunday, Ashley Estwanik, 37, and her family joined the throngs of travelers happy to be departing New York.\n\n\u201cMy kids had never experienced weather like this,\u201d said Ms. Estwanik, who was returning home to Bermuda. \u201cThey were a little excited, but after a while, it was like, \u2018Can we go back inside now?\u2019 \u201d\n\nNikita Stewart and John Surico contributed reporting.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2015, on page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Temperatures So Frigid That Even an Ice Bar Turned Into a Refuge.

He was 74.\n\nDr. Nate Brown, the coroner for Bolivar County, Miss., said Mr. Speakes, who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, died at his home in Cleveland, Miss.\n\nA Southerner who started many days in his White House office by listening to Mozart for what he said was its calming influence, Mr. Speakes served as acting White House press secretary from 1981 to 1987, parrying the increasingly adversarial queries from the press along the way. His nickname among friends was \u201cthe Mississippi catfish,\u201d a fish that stings when mishandled.\n\nHe worked in the West Wing in a pre-Internet era, when the tense exchanges with reporters took place twice a day and deadlines were geared toward the morning papers and the networks\u2019 nightly news programs. He was regarded as having a straightforward but sometimes acerbic style by journalists who bristled at the administration\u2019s attempts to manage the news.\n\nMr. Speakes made news himself in 1988, after he left the White House, when he published a memoir in which he said that as spokesman he had attributed two quotations to Reagan that the president did not say, and later told him about it. The revelations infuriated members of the administration, and Reagan said he did not know of the quotations until Mr. Speakes\u2019 book, \u201cSpeaking Out,\u201d was published.\n\nDuring the ensuing furor, Mr. Speakes resigned from his job as senior vice president for communications at Merrill Lynch. He later told The Washington Post that he had been \u201coverzealous\u201d and that he had \u201cwronged President Reagan.\u201d\n\nBut he did not apologize. \u201cThe truth never requires apology,\u201d he told The Post.\n\nWhen he was in the White House, some journalists questioned whether Mr. Speakes had the access necessary to give him credibility. At times, his job seemed less about communicating policy than handling television personalities like Sam Donaldson of ABC News, who became famous for the questions he shouted at the president from the airport tarmac or White House rope line.\n\nMr. Speakes also fought battles inside the White House with presidential advisers as they all struggled for influence and access to Reagan.\n\nBut Mr. Speakes survived in the briefing room longer than most modern presidential press secretaries, in part because of his laid-back Southern style, which often hid the ambition that is always present in political operatives who make it to the White House.\n\nLarry Melvin Speakes was born on Sept. 13, 1939, at a hospital in Cleveland, Miss., that, he wrote in \u201cSpeaking Out,\u201d was the closest to his parents\u2019 home in Merigold, Miss.\n\nHe was the son of Harry Earl Speakes and the former Ethlyn Frances Fincher. His father was a banker in Merigold, and Mr. Speakes called himself \u201cas middle class as you could get,\u201d marrying his high-school sweetheart before attending the University of Mississippi in Oxford.\n\nMr. Speakes is survived by a daughter, Sandy Speakes Huerta of Cleveland, Miss.; two sons, Scott Speakes of Cleveland and Jeremy Speakes of Clifton, Va.; six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.\n\nHe worked for small-town newspapers in Mississippi before starting his political career in the late 1960s as press secretary for Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi. That led to jobs at the White House and then as a spokesman for President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s Watergate lawyer. He later worked for President Gerald R. Ford and Senator Bob Dole before getting the call from Mr. Brady to be his deputy after Mr. Reagan\u2019s victory.\n\nAfter the shooting, Mr. Speakes took over Mr. Brady\u2019s duties, though he never got the title of press secretary, out of respect for his wounded colleague. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s important to Jim, the title is his,\u201d he told a reporter for The New York Times in 1985.\n\nAs Reagan increasingly ran into political trouble \u2014 including an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran \u2014 it was Mr. Speakes who was often called upon to deflect the attacks.\n\nOnce, when a reporter asked him whether the United States would seek to invade the island nation of Grenada, Mr. Speakes said \u2014 on the advice of an official at the National Security Council \u2014 that the idea was \u201cpreposterous.\u201d The invasion took place the next day, and Mr. Speakes later acknowledged that he had learned about the assault after it had begun.\n\n\u201cThat was the most difficult,\u201d he recalled in 1985. \u201cI was misled. I ended up giving incorrect information. We were left out.\u201d\n\nIn that same interview, he said, \u201cThere are 10,000 ways to say, \u2018No comment,\u2019 and I\u2019ve used 9,999 of them.\u201d\n\nElena Schneider and Steve Kenny contributed reporting.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on January 11, 2014, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Larry Speakes Dies at 74; Public Face of Reagan Era.

More Photos \u00bb\n\nMr. Ouattara had seemed to make headway in re-establishing a tentative sense of normalcy on Friday, announcing a campaign to restore electricity and water after a week of fighting in Abidjan, the economic capital seized by his forces in their push to oust the nation\u2019s strongman, Laurent Gbagbo.\n\nResidents ventured out for the first time in days as gunfire diminished. The European Union, heeding Mr. Ouattara\u2019s appeals, agreed to lift the sanctions it had placed on the country\u2019s two ports to suffocate Mr. Gbagbo\u2019s rule.\n\nAnd after days of trying to extract Mr. Gbagbo forcibly from his stronghold in the presidential residence, Mr. Ouattara shifted tactics, saying he would pin him inside and seal him off. It is the same strategy Mr. Gbagbo used after refusing to step down upon losing the presidential election in November: He blockaded Mr. Ouattara into a lagoonside hotel for months.\n\nBut spokesmen for Mr. Gbagbo said he was not conceding, and it was clear Friday that the country\u2019s crisis had not ended.\n\nThe French Embassy in Abidjan came under mortar and rocket fire late Friday afternoon from positions held by troops loyal to Mr. Gbagbo, the French Foreign Ministry said. It was the second time in two days that the embassy had come under attack.\n\nSome news reports, citing witnesses, said French forces quickly struck back at Mr. Gbagbo\u2019s residence, as they had earlier in the week, but spokesmen for France\u2019s Foreign and Defense Ministries said they had no knowledge of any such military operation on Friday.\n\nForces loyal to Mr. Gbagbo have also regained ground in Abidjan and taken control of the neighborhoods of Plateau and Cocody, the United Nations peacekeeping chief, Alain Le Roy, said late Friday afternoon.\n\nMr. Le Roy said Mr. Gbagbo had used the pretense of engaging in negotiations this week as a trick to consolidate his position, and had reinforced the areas with weapons even as his envoys had been in international talks. Mr. Le Roy said the three generals who entered into talks with the United Nations about surrendering earlier in the week had done so as a ruse to buy time.\n\n\u201cIt was a trick to consolidate his position in these two neighborhoods,\u201d he said.\n\nFrance and the United Nations initiated attacks on Monday against Mr. Gbagbo\u2019s heavy weapons to protect the civilians who have been targeted by them. Yet Mr. Gbagbo still had weaponry, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, and continued to use them against civilians and the United Nations headquarters, Mr. Le Roy said.\n\nAs Mr. Ouattara\u2019s rival gained ground inside the city, Mr. Ouattara faced challenges in other parts of the country. On Friday, the United Nations announced the discovery of more than 100 additional bodies in the nation\u2019s west, in areas that Mr. Ouattara\u2019s forces took as they swept toward Abidjan.\n\nThe dead were members of an ethnic group that supports Mr. Gbagbo, and the killings \u2014 coming after the deaths of hundreds of people in a western town controlled by forces loyal to Mr. Ouattara \u2014 have cast a shadow on Mr. Ouattara\u2019s beginnings as president.\n\nIn a speech late Thursday, Mr. Ouattara took on the issue directly, warning the troops supporting him not to attack or steal from civilians, and promising that those who did would be punished.\n\nBut the warning may have come too late.\n\n\u201cThe reports that the U.N. human rights team in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are sending back are utterly horrifying,\u201d the United Nations\u2019 human rights commissioner, Navi Pillays, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThey are finding more bodies every day,\u201d she said, noting that more than 100 were found in the towns of Du\u00e9kou\u00e9, Blolequin and Guiglo.\n\nThe United Nations said Blolequin was now a \u201cdead town,\u201d with its population gone, and the town thoroughly looted.\n\nSome of the victims appear to have been burned alive, and some bodies had been thrown down a well, a United Nations spokesman said in Geneva. Human Rights Watch also found evidence of \u201cheinous violence\u201d by troops allied with Mr. Ouattara on a trip to the region, a researcher for the organization, Matt Wells, said Friday.\n\nIn one case, 20 elderly and immobile people from the pro-Gbagbo Guerre ethnic group were executed, and in Du\u00e9kou\u00e9, fighters loyal to Mr. Ouattara pulled men and children out of homes \u201cand executed them at point-blank range,\u201d Mr. Wells said.\n\nThe country\u2019s crisis is far from over, but in Abidjan, besieged citizens tested a fragile, sporadic calm.\n\n\u201cPeople went out today to do shopping, to buy supplies,\u201d said Ben Sylla, a Ouattara youth leader who lives in the Adjam\u00e9 neighborhood. \u201cLife is beginning again, slowly, slowly.\u201d\n\nAdam Nossiter reported from Accra, and Dan Bilefsky from the United Nations.

In California, businesses have turned to elected officials, including the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, to lobby federal immigration authorities against raiding long-established companies.\n\nWhile much of the employer activity has been at the grass-roots level, a national federation has been created to bring together the local and state business groups that have sprung up over the last year.\n\n\u201cThese employers are now starting to realize that nobody is in a better position than they are to make the case that they do need the workers and they do want to be on the right side of the law,\u201d said Tamar Jacoby, president of the new federation, ImmigrationWorks USA.\n\nAfter years of laissez-faire enforcement, federal immigration agents have been conducting raids at a brisk pace, with 4,940 arrests in workplaces last year. Although immigration has long been a federal issue, more than 175 bills were introduced in states this year concerning the employment of immigrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nState lawmakers said they had acted against businesses, often in response to fervent demands from voters, to curb job incentives that were attracting shadow populations of illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cIllegal immigration is a threat to the safety of Missouri families and the security of their jobs,\u201d Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, said after the Missouri Legislature passed a crackdown law in May. \u201cI am pleased that lawmakers heeded my call to continue the fight where Washington has failed to act.\u201d\n\nBut because of the mobilization of businesses, the state proposals this year have increasingly reflected their concerns. State lawmakers \u201care starting to be more responsive to the employer community because of its engagement in the issue,\u201d said Ann Morse, who monitors immigration for the national legislature conference.\n\nThe offensive by businesses has been spurred by the federal enforcement crackdown, by inaction in Congress on immigration legislation and by a rush of punitive state measures last year that created a checkerboard of conflicting requirements. Many employers found themselves on the political defensive as they grappled, even in an economic downturn, with shortages of low-wage labor.\n\nMike Gilsdorf, the owner of a 37-year-old landscaping nursery in Littleton, Colo., saw the need for action by businesses last winter when he advertised with the Labor Department, as he does every year, for 40 seasonal workers at market-rate wages to plant, prune and carry his shrubs in the summer heat. Only one local worker responded to the notice, he said, and then did not show up for the job.\n\nMr. Gilsdorf was able to fill his labor force with legal immigrants from Mexico through a federal guest worker program. But that program has a tight annual cap, and Mr. Gilsdorf realized that he might not be so lucky next year. His business could fail, he said, and then even his American workers would lose their jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hiring illegals, we\u2019re not paying under the table,\u201d Mr. Gilsdorf said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t get in under the cap and nobody is answering our ads, we don\u2019t have employees.\u201d His group, Colorado Employers for Immigration Reform, is pressing Congress for a much larger and more flexible guest worker program.\n\nUnhappy California businesses won the support of Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, who wrote a letter in March to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff criticizing immigration agents for aiming raids at \u201cestablished, responsible employers\u201d in the city and urging him to focus on those with a record of labor violations.\n\nIn Virginia, an employers\u2019 coalition headed off bills that would have closed businesses that hire illegal immigrants and would have required all employers to participate in the federal system to check the working papers of new hires, which is known as E-Verify. Business groups nationwide oppose mandatory use of the system, which is now voluntary, because they say the Social Security Administration database it draws upon is full of errors that could lead to job denials for American citizens and legal immigrants and bureaucratic overload for the agency.\n\nVirginia employers said they learned a lesson last year after the broad immigration bill they supported failed in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe silent masses of businesses out there should have been on the phone with their Congressional representatives calling for rational reform,\u201d said Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation, whose members include some of the biggest low-wage employers in the state. Virginia lawmakers ultimately adopted verification rules aimed at employers who systematically hire illegal immigrants.\n\nIn this legislative session, Arizona businesses rallied behind a bill to create what would have been the first state guest worker program in the country. Their advertising campaign used the slogan \u201cWhat part of legal don\u2019t you understand?\u201d \u2014 a tweak of the battle cry of their opponents, who use the same phrase with the word \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nArizona employers said they knew that passage would be difficult for the bill, because only the federal government can issue visas to immigrant workers.\n\nAlthough the bill never came to a vote, employers said the debate helped make their views known in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message to the federal government,\u201d said Joe Sigg, director of government relations for the Arizona Farm Bureau, \u201cthat we need a legal and reliable means to recruit workers.\u201d\n\nEmployers\u2019 groups have not succeeded everywhere. Under a bill passed this year, Mississippi is the first state to make it a felony for an illegal immigrant to work. The measure also allows terminated employees to sue their employer if they were replaced by an illegal immigrant.\n\nPresident Bush on June 9 ordered all federal contractors to check new workers with E-Verify. The administration is pressing forward with a rule that would pressure employers to fire within 90 days any worker whose identity information does not match the records of the Social Security Administration, as frequently happens with illegal immigrants. The first version of the rule was held up last year by a federal court injunction.\n\nWhile many businesses have come forward, they say they speak for many others with immigrant workers that are lying low after finding that the crackdown has left them in a perilous legal bind. While raids and sanctions are increasing, employers with low-wage immigrant workers are barred by antidiscrimination rules from examining identity documents of new hires too closely or checking the immigration status of employees after they have been hired.\n\n\u201cThe problem for business is that despite their complete compliance with the law, it is inevitable for employers with large numbers of immigrant workers that a certain percentage will be unauthorized workers using false documents,\u201d said Peter Schey, a lawyer who represents two California companies facing scrutiny by federal immigration agents. \u201cThe system is just as broken for employers as it is for immigrants.\u201d\n\nOne employer facing this problem is the chief executive of a $20 million company on the outskirts of Los Angeles that assembles electronic parts. She said she had come to fear that her company \u2014 including its legal workers \u2014 is at risk of being crippled by an immigration raid.\n\nThe executive spoke on the condition that neither she nor her company be identified by name, for fear of attracting immigration authorities.\n\nA human resources manager who worked for the company a decade ago hired a number of workers without conducting an extra check of their documents with the Social Security Administration, the executive said. Now she has received notices from the agency of mismatches in the identity documents of 20 workers who were hired 10 years ago, out of 90 workers on the assembly floor today.\n\nBecause of the antidiscrimination rules, the executive cannot check to be certain that the 20 workers, mainly Hispanic women, are illegal. Moreover, they have advanced through training, she said, and excel at their jobs, which require the repetitive assembly of tiny parts by hand, often under microscopes.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t replace those people,\u201d the executive said. She said that despite offering competitive wages from $9 to $17 an hour, the company had failed over the years in repeated efforts to attract nonimmigrant workers because of the state\u2019s tight technology labor market and because of the nature of the work, exacting and tedious. If the workers were fired or arrested, she said, she could fail to meet her contracts.\n\n\u201cIf we have to terminate 20 people, that\u2019s going to jeopardize 100 other jobs of people who are legal, Americans, people who are making a good living,\u201d she said.\n\nAngelo Paparelli, an immigration lawyer who represents the company, said: \u201cThis is not an employer who wants to turn a blind eye to lawbreaking. She is facing a tightening of the enforcement vise that does not take into account Congress\u2019s failure to create a workable system.\u201d\n\nCalifornia employers were shocked by the raid earlier this year at Micro Solutions Enterprises, an established manufacturer of printer cartridges that is based in Los Angeles and has more than 800 workers. Officials said 138 workers were arrested. In a message to his customers, Avi Wazana, the Micro Solutions owner, said the company had been verifying the legal status of all new hires through federal programs for nearly a year.\n\nBush administration officials said the crackdown was the price employers must pay to persuade voters to agree to open the gates to immigrant workers. In an interview, Mr. Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, said, \u201cWe are not going to be able to satisfy the American people on a legal temporary worker program until they are convinced that we will have a stick as well as a carrot.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Employers Fight Tough Measures On Immigration.

She was 78 and lived in Las Vegas.\n\nRuth Brown performing at the 15th Annual Chicago Blues Festival in 1998.\n\nThe cause was complications following a heart attack and a stroke she suffered after surgery, and Ms. Brown had been on life support since Oct. 29, said her friend, lawyer and executor, Howell Begle.\n\n\u0093She was one of the original divas,\u0094 said the singer Bonnie Raitt, who worked with Ms. Brown and Mr. Begle to improve royalties for rhythm and blues performers. \u0093I can\u0092t really say that I\u0092ve heard anyone that sounds like Ruth, before or after. She was a combination of sass and innocence, and she was extremely funky. She could really put it right on the beat, and the tone of her voice was just mighty. And she had a great heart.\u0094\n\n\u0093What I loved about her,\u0094 Ms. Raitt added, \u0093was her combination of vulnerability and resilience and fighting spirit. It was not arrogance, but she was just really not going to lay down and roll over for anyone.\u0094\n\nMs. Brown sustained a career for six decades: first as a bright, bluesy singer who was called \u0093the girl with a tear in her voice\u0094 and then, after some lean years, as the embodiment of an earthy, indomitable black woman. She had a life of hard work, hard luck, determination, audacity and style. Sometimes it was said that R&B stood as much for Ruth Brown as it did for rhythm and blues.\n\nAs the 1950s began, Ms. Brown\u0092s singles for the fledgling Atlantic Records \u0097 like \u0093(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean\u0094 and \u00935-10-15 Hours\u0094 \u0097 became both the label\u0092s bankroll and templates for all of rock \u0092n\u0092 roll. She could sound as if she were hurting, or joyfully lusty, or both at once. Her voice was forthright, feisty and ready for anything.\n\nAfter Ms. Brown\u0092s string of hits ended, she kept singing but also went on to a career in television, radio and movies ( including a memorable role as the disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle in John Waters\u0092s \u0093Hairspray\u0094) and on Broadway, where she won a Tony Award for her part in \u0093Black and Blue.\u0094 She worked clubs, concerts and festivals into the 21st century.\n\n\u0093Whatever I have to say, I get it said,\u0094 she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995. \u0093Like the old spirituals say, \u0091I\u0092ve gone too far to turn me \u0092round now.\u0092 \u0094\n\nMs. Brown was born Ruth Weston on Jan. 12, 1928, in Portsmouth, Va., the oldest of seven children. She made her debut when she was 4, and her father, the choir director at the local Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, lifted her onto the church piano. In summers, she and her siblings picked cotton at her grandmother\u0092s farm in North Carolina. \u0093That made me the strong woman I am,\u0094 she said in 1995.\n\nAs a teenager, she would tell her family she was going to choir practice and perform instead at U.S.O. clubs at nearby naval stations. She ran away from home at 17, working with a trumpeter named Jimmy Brown and using his last name onstage. She married him, or thought she did; he was already married. But she was making a reputation as Ruth Brown, and the name stuck.\n\nThe big-band leader Lucky Millinder heard her in Detroit late in 1946, hired her for his band and fired her in Washington, D.C. . Stranded, she managed to find a club engagement at the Crystal Caverns. There, the disc jockey Willis Conover, who broadcast jazz internationally on Voice of America radio, heard Ms. Brown and recommended her to friends at Atlantic Records.\n\nOn the way to New York City, however, she was seriously injured in an automobile accident and hospitalized for most of a year; her legs, which were smashed, would be painful for the rest of her life. She stood on crutches in 1949 to record her first session for Atlantic, and the bluesy ballad \u0093So Long\u0094 became a hit.\n\nShe wanted to keep singing ballads, but Atlantic pushed her to try upbeat songs, and she tore into them. During the sessions for \u0093Teardrops From My Eyes,\u0094 her voice cracked upward to a squeal. Herb Abramson of Atlantic Records liked it, called it a \u0093tear,\u0094 and after \u0093Teardrops\u0094 reached No. 1 on the rhythm and blues chart, the sound became her trademark for a string of hits.\n\n\u0093If I was getting ready to go and record and I had a bad throat, they\u0092d say, \u0091Good!\u0092,\u0094 she once recalled.\n\nMs. Brown was the best-selling black female performer of the early 1950s, even though, in that segregated era, many of her songs were picked up and redone by white singers, like Patti Page and Georgia Gibbs, in tamer versions that became pop hits.

Hambrecht, the chief business development officer for Phillips auction house. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe amount of money being spent is mind-boggling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe purchasing is directed through intermediaries by Sheika al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, chairwoman of the Qatar Museums Authority and a sister to Qatar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new emir. At age 30 she has become one of the most influential players in the art world.\n\nNo one knows exactly how much Sheika al Mayassa has spent on behalf of her family or the museum authority since she was named chairwoman by her father, the former emir, in 2006. But experts estimate the acquisition budget reaches $1 billion a year and say the Qataris have used it to secure a host of undisputed modern and contemporary masterpieces by Francis Bacon, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons.\n\nWhere all this art will eventually end up remains something of a mystery. But it seems clear that, just as Qatar has used its oil riches to boost its influence in the Middle East with ventures like arming Syrian rebels, its wealth is also being deployed to help the country become a force in the world of culture.\n\nThis effort to create a first-class contemporary art collection, essentially from scratch, has buoyed the international art market, experts say, and contributed to some of the escalation in prices.\n\nUntil Qatar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2007 purchase, for example, the most expensive Rothko ever sold at auction (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHomage to Matisse\u00e2\u0080\u009d) had drawn $22 million in 2005, less than one-third of the price Qatar paid. In 2011 the $250 million spent for \u00e2\u0080\u009cCard Players\u00e2\u0080\u009d was four times the highest public price ever paid for a work by that artist.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen they finish their buying program and withdraw from the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Nash, a New York dealer who spent 35 years as a top executive with Sotheby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey will leave a big hole which I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see anyone else ready to fill at their level.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn recent years the Qatar Museums Authority has created three high-profile museums in the capital, Doha, by the architects Jean Nouvel, I. M. Pei and Jean-Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Bodin. But each of these projects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a new home for the National Museum of Qatar now under construction; the Museum of Islamic Art; and Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is focused on regional art and artists. So experts expect that a good portion of the Western collection being amassed will become part of a new contemporary art institution in the country, though officials have yet to announce that.\n\nThe annual acquisition budgets of major museums typically amount to just a small fraction of what Qatar is spending. The Museum of Modern Art, for example, spent $32 million to acquire art for the fiscal year that ended in June 2012; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, $39 million.\n\nWhile other gulf states like Abu Dhabi and Dubai are also trying to become cultural capitals, those two members of the United Arab Emirates have teamed up with existing institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 namely the Louvre and the Guggenheim \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to establish themselves. Qatar, meanwhile, is going it alone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey see themselves as an international center for many cultures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Allen L. Keiswetter, a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt establishes them as another reason to be a destination for travel, for business. If you want to attract people, you need to have a reason to go there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSheika al Mayassa declined to be interviewed for this article, but she has made limited remarks about the role art will play in Qatar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a 2010 TED Talk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cArt becomes a very important part of our national identity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn an interview that year with The New York Times, the sheika suggested that establishing art institutions might challenge Western preconceptions about Muslim societies.", "summary": "While studiously avoiding fanfare, a sister of the emir of this small Persian Gulf state has become one of the international art world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important players.", "compression": 32.1785714286, "coverage": 0.8214285714, "density": 1.8928571429, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}
