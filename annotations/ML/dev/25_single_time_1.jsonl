In 2007 Sotomayor, as a member of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, heard arguments in the case of Ricci v. DeStefano. In that case, white firefighters in New Haven, Conn., challenged the city's decision to ignore the results of a promotion test after there were no black firefighters among the top scorers. One of 20 white firefighters who brought the case, Frank Ricci, is dyslexic and paid an acquaintance more than $1,000 to read study guides for the test onto audiotapes. Ricci scored sixth out of 77 \u0097 high enough to merit the promotion. But the city, fearing that it could be sued for discrimination, decided to promote no one.\n\nDuring the oral argument for the case, Sotomayor was an active questioner, but the decision eventually released by her three-judge panel was a brief, unsigned order. With little explanation, it affirmed the lower-court decision dismissing the firefighters' claim that the city discriminated against the white firefighters by throwing out the test. In a subsequent opinion, one of Sotomayor's colleagues and longtime mentors, Judge Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, criticized the panel for disposing in such a cursory way issues that were \"indisputably complex and far from well-settled.\" Ricci and the others appealed the panel's ruling, and the case is now before the Supreme Court. (See pictures of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.)\n\nRepublican critics of Sotomayor are planning to use the Ricci decision as Exhibit A in what they hope will be confirmation hearings focused on her views about race. Exhibit B is a speech she delivered in 2001 that included the following 32 words: \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\" Since President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the court on May 26, that remark has become the main source of conservative attacks. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told his followers on Twitter that Sotomayor was a \"Latina woman racist\" who should withdraw. (He later apologized.) Sotomayor expressed regret about her word choice to Senator Dianne Feinstein. But after the Senate Judiciary Committee released Sotomayor's complete list of speeches, it emerged that she had delivered many versions of the same stump speech \u0097 seven by one count \u0097 between 1994 and 2003. In all of them, she suggested that a judge who was a \"wise woman\" or a \"wise Latina woman\" would issue a better opinion than a male or a white male judge.\n\nSotomayor's defenders say that those words were taken out of context and that her appellate opinions are hardly radical on race. Tom Goldstein of SCOTUS Blog has estimated that of the 96 race-related cases other than Ricci she heard on the Court of Appeals, \"Judge Sotomayor rejected discrimination-related claims by a [ratio] of roughly 8 to 1.\" (See the top 10 Supreme Court nomination battles.)\n\nSo, what does she actually believe? An examination of Sotomayor's career supports the idea that on the bench, she has been a racial moderate, not a radical. At the same time, her opinions and speeches suggest that her views about race, multiculturalism and identity politics are more nuanced, complex and provocative than either her critics or her supporters have allowed. And for that reason, if confirmed, she could influence the racially charged issues the Supreme Court will confront over the next few decades in unexpected ways.\n\nThe Richness of Experience The first speech in which Sotomayor introduced the \"wise Latina\" theme was delivered in Puerto Rico in 1994 and focused not on race but on gender. Sotomayor was responding to an article written by a colleague, Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, a federal judge in New York. Cedarbaum, like Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was an \"equal treatment\" feminist, who had expressed concern about the premise that women judges necessarily approach cases differently than men do. \"Generalizations about the way women or men are,\" Ginsburg famously said, \"cannot guide me reliably in making decisions about particular individuals.\"\n\nRead \"Four Enduring Myths About Supreme Court Nominees.\"\n\nWatch TIME's video \"Sonia Sotomayor: Bronx (and Baseball) Role Model.\"", "summary": "A controversial speech has complicated Sonia Sotomayor's path to the Supreme Court.

I\u2019m also regularly asked things, like, \u201cDo spicy foods really boost metabolism?\u201d or \u201cDo I really need eight glasses of water a day?\u201d It seems there are a number of eating and drinking wives tales many people still wonder about, including some that are particularly relevant this time of year, like those dealing with colds and hangovers. To set the record straight on seven food-focused notions check out my roundup below. You may be surprised by which beliefs are solid, which are rooted in truth but often exaggerated, and which are just flat-out false.\n\nMyth: Turkey makes you sleepy\n\nThis myth stems from the fact that turkey contains tryptophan, an amino acid that ups the brain chemical serotonin, used to make melatonin, which are both helpful for sleep. But the truth is the connection isn\u2019t quite that simple or direct. First, turkey isn\u2019t unique in its tryptophan content. The amino acid is also found in chicken, as long with other meats, fish, dairy, and eggs (and you probably haven\u2019t felt sleepy after an omelet).\n\nWithout a hefty helping of carbohydrates, which make tryptophan more available to your brain, you probably won\u2019t feel sleepy.\n\nThe real reason turkey has been tagged as a snooze inducer is because Thanksgiving is a day of overeating for most people. Stuffing yourself with too much food diverts blood flow to your gut, which is the real brain drainer and energy zapper. So if you want to feel alert go ahead and eat some lean turkey, as long as it\u2019s part of a balanced meal and not super-sized.\n\nFact: Chicken soups helps with a cold\n\nThis one has science on its side. A famous 2000 study from the University of Nebraska Medical Center found that chicken soup has an anti-inflammatory effect, which may help ease pain or discomfort.\n\nChicken soup can also speed up the movement of mucus through the nose to relieve congestion. While cold beverages can slow the draining of mucous secretions, hot liquids thin them, so they\u2019ll drain faster, which provides some relief. In addition, you tend to lose more fluid when you\u2019re sick, from perspiration, or coughing, and the salt from soup can help keep you hydrated because it triggers water retention. If you don\u2019t eat chicken, a veggie soup will do nicely, and either way adding veggies is a smart way to boost your nutrient intake and bolster immunity.\n\nMyth: Alcohol helps you sleep\n\nThere have been more than 25 studies published about alcohol\u2019s impact on sleep, and while it\u2019s true that alcohol tends to reduce the amount of time it takes to fall asleep, it also disrupts overall sleep, particularly important REM sleep, which is mentally restorative.\n\nAnd the more you drink, the worse the impact.\n\nIf you have trouble sleeping be sure to cut off caffeine at least six hours before bed, keep your room cool, dark, and quiet, and instead of a glass of wine try even five minutes of meditation, deep breathing, or progressive relaxation (focusing on relaxing your body, starting with the tips of your toes, up to the top of your head), either before bed, or after you\u2019ve tucked in.\n\nMyth: Hair of the dog helps a hangover\n\nWhile imbibing in the a.m. may help temporarily, you\u2019ll rebound right back to hangover symptoms, and probably even intensify them. Having another drink forces your body to prioritize metabolizing the new alcohol, so you get a brief reprieve from the chemical aftermath of the previous night\u2019s cocktails. But as soon as the new alcohol gets processed, you\u2019re back where you started, except this time with even more toxins in your system. While preventing a hangover is your best bet, if you\u2019ve already done the damage the true remedies are time, rest, and lots of H2O. Adding some electrolytes may also help with hydration, which is why pickle juice and coconut water are often cited as hangover helpers.\n\nFact: A spoonful of honey is good for coughs\n\nHoney contains natural anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial substances. In fact, in one study, more than 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections were given either a honey flavored cough suppressant, nothing, or up to two teaspoons of pure honey before bed. The real honey not only reduced nighttime coughing and improved sleep, but it was just as effective as the over the counter medication.\n\nNext time your throat hurts, ease the discomfort by mixing a little honey with warm water and lemon, or simply swallow honey straight from the spoon. (Note: Due to the risk of infant botulism, never give honey to a child younger than age of one.)\n\nMyth: Spicy foods cause ulcers\n\nWe now know that ulcers aren\u2019t caused by worrying, or eating spicy foods that \u201cburn holes\u201d in your stomach. Eighty to 90% of ulcers are caused by H. pylori bacteria, and as a result are treated with antibiotics.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re currently being treated for an ulcer avoiding spicy foods is a good idea until it has healed. But in general, having chili peppers in your diet may offer a number of health benefits, including boosting metabolism, thinning the blood, which lowers the risk of stroke, reducing the risk of certain cancers, supporting immunity, and reducing inflammation, a known trigger of premature aging and chronic disease.\n\nFact: Drinking water helps you lose weight\n\nWhile it\u2019s not true that you lose weight with every sip of water you drink there have been published studies to support the connection between water and weight management. One found that when adults downed two cups of water right before eating a meal they ate between 75 and 90 fewer calories. A second study, conducted by the same researchers, found that when two groups of people followed the same calorie-controlled plan for 12 weeks, those who drank two cups of water before meals lost about 15.5 pounds, compared to about 11 pounds in the non-water drinking group.\n\nPlus, there is some research to show that water offers a slight metabolic boost. One German study found that drinking 16 ounces (2 cups) of water upped calorie burning by 30%. The effect was triggered within 10 minutes and sustained for over an hour. And while the impact was small, in terms of the total extra number of calories burned, day after day those little boosts can add up.\n\nCynthia Sass, MPH, RD, is Health\u2019s contributing nutrition editor, and privately counsels clients in New York, Los Angeles, and long distance.

No surprise there: car companies know their audience, and big parts of this one like to ride around the suburbs in two-ton hunks of metal. But I was surprised to see that the TV spot focused on the fuel efficiency of the F-150, which gets all of 23 m.p.g. on the highway.\n\nThere are two ways to take this kind of ad. One is that it's truly sad if Americans actually think that 23 m.p.g. makes for an efficient vehicle, especially when gasoline costs over $3.40 a gal. and the average Chinese car has to get some 35 m.p.g. to be allowed out of the factory. The other is that if truck brands are being forced to tout their efficiency in ads \u0097 as opposed to their ability to tow 747s \u0097 then at least fuel economy has gone mainstream. As well it should: a recent report from the New America Foundation estimated that Americans will spend nearly half a trillion dollars on gasoline this year, up 25% from what they spent in 2010. (See if gas-powered cars are more fuel-efficient than you think.)\n\nIt's clear we can't afford to guzzle gas anymore \u0097 and neither can the environment. That's why we should welcome President Obama's new proposal to increase auto-fuel-efficiency standards to 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025. That would be a doubling of standards, which are already set to increase to 35.4 m.p.g. by 2016. Automakers \u0097 who worry about how expensive and popular efficient cars will be \u0097 and many Republicans are skeptical of tougher fuel-efficiency standards, but the White House says the rules could save consumers an average of $6,600 over the life of a 2025 vehicle. \"We expect this program will not only save consumers money, it will ensure automakers have the regulatory certainty they need to make key decision that create jobs and invest in the future,\" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement.\n\nBut the fuel-efficiency proposal could be just the first step to a leaner, meaner and greener economy \u0097 at least, if Amory Lovins has anything to say about it. Lovins, a former TIME 100 honoree, is chairman of the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a think tank dedicated to promoting energy efficiency and renewable power. But that description doesn't do justice to the scope of Lovins' vision. In his new book, Reinventing Fire, Lovins lays out a blueprint for essentially eliminating fossil fuels \u0097 using vastly improved energy efficiency as a cornerstone. \"From a business perspective, this transition can be done, and it can be done profitably,\" Lovins told me on a recent trip to New York. (See how the White House has put out fuel-efficiency standards for heavy vehicles.)\n\nRight now, Lovins points out, the U.S. uses 93 quadrillion BTUs of energy per year \u0097 with about four-fifths of that figure coming from fossil fuels like coal and oil. Current government projections estimate that U.S. energy consumption will keep increasing, rising to 117 quads by 2050. That's conventional wisdom; an economy will use more energy as it continues to grow, and current economic woes notwithstanding, growth will return. Our best hope then is to get out ahead of the energy-consumption curve, generating more economic output for every unit of energy consumed.\n\nBut Lovins believes there's another way \u0097 that with the right policies, we can actually shrink energy use nearly 25% by 2050 while more than doubling the economy, cutting carbon emissions 80% and saving money. How? Lovins predicts that coal and oil and other fossil fuels will become increasingly expensive over time, even as wind and solar continue to fall in price, which will speed the transition to renewable energy. But efficiency will be even more important, as we use the savings from reducing energy waste to fund that shift. And Lovins sees a lot of waste around. \"Buildings use three-quarters of our energy, and most of that is wasted,\" he says. \"The savings we can reap are worth far more than the costs [of greater efficiency].\" (Read about the 12 most important cars of all time.)\n\nTake cars, for instance. Lovins has long been obsessed with the inefficiency of the American automobile, going so far as designing his own Hypercar, an ultra-light vehicle that, if built, would easily get more than 100 m.p.g. He looks at popular American vehicles \u0097 like that Ford F-150 \u0097 and sees bulky vehicles that sacrifice efficiency for weight and engine size. Two-thirds of the energy needed to move an automobile is necessitated by its weight \u0097 so if you remove weight, you instantly improve efficiency. In the past, smaller and lighter cars might have been less safe, but Lovins notes that new manufacturing technologies can use carbon fiber to make ultra-light but strong vehicles that could in turn use smaller and far more efficient engines, cutting weight further. \"We pay for efficiency by making things smaller and lighter,\" says Lovins.\n\nIt's worth checking out Reinventing Fire for a fuller helping of his larger vision; you can get the highlights at RMI's website. But while the inexhaustible Lovins has a technical answer for every objection to his ideas, there's no shortage of obstacles to a radically different energy future. There's still resistance to the sort of mandates and regulations needed to boost energy efficiency. Lovins might be fine with significantly smaller and lighter cars, but the enduring popularity of the SUV in the U.S. indicates that Americans may not be so ready to shrink their ride. And there's also an ongoing debate over what's known as the rebound effect \u0097 the possibility that as we become more energy-efficient, we use the economic savings to consume more energy, eroding the environmental benefit.\n\nBut while the Lovins plan may not be perfect, it points us in the right direction. In a crowded and constrained world, we need to squeeze every drop of value out of every unit of energy we have, renewable or not. Tighter fuel-economy standards are a great start \u0097 and Obama deserves credit for quietly pursuing policies to improve energy efficiency \u0097 but we can do more. \"It doesn't matter whether you care most about jobs or profits or national security or health or the environment,\" says Lovins. \"This is an outcome we need, and we can get it done.\" There's no more time \u0097 or energy \u0097 to waste.\n\nSee the future of your truck or SUV.\n\nSee photos of new hybrid cars for 2011.", "summary": "Climate visionary Amory Lovins has an energy blueprint for America \u0097 and it's a good one", "compression": 76.7058823529, "coverage": 0.8235294118, "density": 1.5294117647, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary_and_strapline", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Here, the actress \u2014 who celebrates her 40th birthday today! \u2014 talks to TIME.\n\nTIME: Given how long HIMYM\u2019s been on, it\u2019s hard to ask you finale-related questions that aren\u2019t just hugely broad. Like, how do you feel?\n\nYou know, I think I did most of my grieving at the end of the season because now I feel like, \u2018Oh, that was great!\u2019 This ninth season was shot around so many different schedules, and it was such a weird season that it was almost like our methadone. It was a nice way of getting used to not seeing everyone every day of the week. So it prepared us for the finality of it all.\n\nWhat are your plans for watching the last episode?\n\nA lot of my Twitter followers asked if I was going to go to New York and be there, because they watch it at the bar that MacLaren\u2019s [the pub on the show] is based on, but I won\u2019t be able to do that. I\u2019ll be shooting a pilot the next day so I\u2019ll have to be here. Besides, all the blubbering I\u2019ll do, I should probably stay at home. I shouldn\u2019t be out in public.\n\nYou mentioned your Twitter followers. How do you feel about the crazy-high fan expectations for the finale?\n\nI would have been worried about it before I actually knew how the show was going to end. The script was just amazing and wonderful and happy and sad and all of the above.\n\nThere\u2019s a fan theory that we\u2019ll discover the mother has been dead all along\u2026\n\nWe could all be dead. Who knows? But I just love that even though it\u2019s only [two] episodes left, people are still trying to figure out the end. As Barney would say, wait for it!\n\nYou clearly don\u2019t share your character\u2019s inability to keep a secret.\n\nIf there is a secret I\u2019d definitely be able to keep it. With the sleep deprivation of the last five years, I\u2019d probably just forget it anyway.\n\nI know Marshall and Lily are based on a real couple \u2013 have you ever applied any of their marriage secrets to your own life?\n\nMy husband came first so I don\u2019t know which one has taught me what, but I definitely think they helped one another. Just being your best friend, each others\u2019 best friends, is what has worked for us and is what is most important. If you\u2019re going to spend that much time with somebody, you want to be friends. That\u2019s what I held dear to my heart with both relationships. I want to like you and love you. That makes everything greater.\n\nWill you ever give your kids a how-I-met-your-dad talk?\n\nI could show them, when they\u2019re old enough. I can say \u2018This is [husband Alexis Denisof's] first episode on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and this is the prom episode where I realized I really liked this guy, then Mommy freaked out and we didn\u2019t date for a year.\u2019\n\nI just heard overalls \u2014 your Buffy wardrobe staple \u2014 are coming back. Willow was ahead of her time, apparently.\n\nI\u2019ve seen them. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m not tempted.\n\nBetween that and her tech savvy, she\u2019d be really cool now.\n\nThe whole show, if it had been on now, would have been much bigger. That\u2019s why I feel like there should be a retroactive Emmy category.\n\nLike, \u2018Sorry we forgot you while you were there. Ally McBeal was really shiny back then.\u2019\n\nAnd you already have your next pilot lined up, for More Time With Family. What\u2019s it like to jump right in to something different?\n\nI love television and it\u2019s been fantastic to me and the best writing right now is on television. I love the family aspect of these long-running shows that I\u2019ve been so lucky to be a part of. I knew that that\u2019s what I wanted to stay in. But coming off of nine years, I wasn\u2019t going to do something unless I absolutely fell in love with it. I was thinking that\u2019d be down the road, and then I read this script. In a way it\u2019s helped me with the closure of How I Met Your Mother, because I have something that I\u2019m so very much looking forward to. Hopefully it won\u2019t be the rebound relationship.

Just thank your lucky stars you weren\u2019t a museum director during any of these thefts.\n\n1) The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, The United States: On March 18, 1990, two thieves disguised as Boston Police officers demanded entrance to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. They told the guard on patrol that they were responding to a disturbance, then drew him away from the alarm button and asked him to call his partner. The thieves then handcuffed both of them and threw them in the basement, where they duct-taped their hands and feet to pipes.\n\nThe bandits then stole around $500 million worth of priceless art, the largest art heist in history. Priceless works like Vermeer\u2019s The Concert, Rembrandt\u2019s Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and Manet\u2019s Chez Tortoni were taken, never to be found again. Empty frames currently hang in some rooms of the Gardner museum where the paintings originally hung, and tourists visit to see the scene of the crime.\n\n2) The Stockholm Museum, Sweden: Armed burglars stole $30 million worth of art by Renoir and Rembrandt from the Stockholm Museum on December 22, 2000. They staged two car explosions nearby to distract police, then a gunman with a semiautomatic terrorized the museum while his accomplishes grabbed a Rembrandt self-portrait and two Renoirs. Then the thieves escaped in a small boat.\n\n3) The Kunstahl Museum, The Netherlands: Romanian gang members stole seven paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Gaugin and Monet in under three minutes from the Kunhstahl Museum in Rotterdam on October 16, 2012. The thieves got away with the artworks, worth more than $24 million, even though they tripped the small museum\u2019s alarm system \u2014 probably because the small museum had no guards.\n\nLast year, the mother of one of the alleged thieves claimed to have burned the paintings, perhaps to protect her son from prosecution. Olga Dogaru\u2019s son was the alleged ringleader of the heist, and his and his accomplices had already been arrested. Dogaru first buried the paintings in different locations, then burned them so the police could never find them. The two thieves have been sentenced to 6-8 years in prison.\n\n4) National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico: Robbers stole 140 precious objects from Mexico\u2019s National Museum of Anthropology on Christmas Eve, 1985, in the largest heist of pre-Colombian objects in history. The bandits picked a sleepy time when they knew the guards would be distracted by holiday cheer, and grabbed several gold, turquoise, and jade objects, as well as an obsidian monkey-shaped-vase worth over $20 million. Most of the stolen objects were very small and easy to transport, making them especially difficult to track down.\n\n5) The Louvre, France: Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa is now the most famous painting in the Louvre, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. In fact, getting stolen might have been the best thing that ever happened to this tiny Renaissance portrait. On August 21, 1911, three Italian handymen hid in a supply closet overnight in order to sneak into the museum and steal the Mona Lisa. One of them, Vincenzo Perugia, was the man who had installed the protective glass over the Mona Lisa in the first place. The theft was all over the French newspapers, since many people feared that German or American businessmen were buying up all the good art from their museums. The painting became so famous that he couldn\u2019t sell it without getting caught. So he hid it in the false bottom of his trunk until over two years later, when he finally tried to sell the painting. Of course, the police showed up, Perugia was arrested, and the painting was returned, more famous than ever.", "summary": "Talk about a sinking feeling in your stomach", "compression": 92.5, "coverage": 0.375, "density": 0.375, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Here are four things we can all learn about data security from the Sony hack.\n\nWhile some reports suggest the Sony hackers had inside help, it\u2019s just as likely they accessed Sony\u2019s systems after a hapless employee clicked a suspicious link in what\u2019s called a \u201cphishing\u201d email. Those emails increasingly target specific employees with very personal messages that make it look like they\u2019re from somebody you trust, but clicking the links they contain can result in malware hitting your computer, infecting your company\u2019s network and leaving it vulnerable.\n\nLearn more about phishing emails and how to detect them on this helpful Microsoft site.\n\nSony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton\u2019s assistants emailed him unencrypted reminders of his passwords for email, banking and online shopping accounts, according to the Associated Press. How does the AP know that? Because those emails were leaked by the Sony hackers along with troves of other data, exposing Lynton to a serious personal security problem. All a hacker with Lynton\u2019s emails had to do was search the cache for \u201cpassword,\u201d and voila, tons of access credentials.\n\nIf you have to communicate passwords with family members or coworkers, the safest solution is a secure password manager like 1Password or LastPass.\n\nEncrypt your most sensitive data\n\nEvery business has sensitive files, like contracts or employees\u2019 medical information. Encryption basically makes files look like a jumbled mess to anyone who doesn\u2019t have the right decoding software, meaning it would have made it much harder for hackers and journalists to get anything useful from Sony\u2019s documents.\n\nMost people don\u2019t go the extra mile and encrypt their private files, but the Sony hack shows we really ought to do that. Lifehacker has a good list of encryption tools here, though top tech companies have increasingly been making encryption the default, especially on mobile devices.\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve got an ace security team\n\nThis tip is more for corporate executives than rank-and-file employees, but it\u2019s crucial that your company\u2019s IT team is up to snuff. Sony Pictures CFO David C. Hendler complained about the company\u2019s poor security policies as recently as October, according to emails leaked in the hack. The Sony hack would have caught many companies flat-footed, but having better security and IT practices might have helped Sony ward off the worst of it\u2014and rebuilding after a hack is far harder and costlier than deflecting one to begin with.", "summary": "Rule #1: Never email your passwords", "compression": 66.875, "coverage": 0.375, "density": 0.375, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Nothing gets the discovery juices flowing like a first glimpse of a whole new world. Still, if you missed the news that the spacecraft Dawn entered orbit around the asteroid Vesta on July 16, you could be forgiven. You don't even have to apologize if you'd never heard of the place; most folks haven't.\n\nThe fact is, Vesta is the second largest object in our solar system's asteroid belt \u0097 and one of the oldest objects in the solar system as a whole \u0097 and Dawn is one of the coolest little spacecraft that NASA has ever built. Together they could yield important clues to the origins of the sun and the planets, not to mention helping NASA engineers demonstrate their increasingly sophisticated cosmic-flying skills. (See meteors striking Earth.)\n\nVesta was discovered in 1807 and immediately intrigued astronomers. About 360 miles (578 km) across \u0097 or roughly the size of Arizona \u0097 it is nearly spherical, with a large crater gouged out of its south pole. More-powerful telescopes have shown that the surface of Vesta is covered with basalt, or hardened lava, suggesting that the asteroid was once geologically active. The crater is presumed to be the result of a collision with a chunk of cosmic debris not long after Vesta's formation 4.5 billion years ago. The giant whack cost the asteroid about 1% of its mass, and the rubble blasted into space may account for up to 5% of the meteorites that have reached Earth's surface. Much more important, the crater provides a peek deep into Vesta's interior, which is the same as peeking at the asteroid's \u0097 and the solar system's \u0097 past.\n\nAll that made Vesta eminently worth visiting, but the job of getting there would not be easy. Dawn, launched in 2007, went first into solar orbit, then began a widening spiral that took it by Mars, where it picked up a gravity boost, and finally to Vesta, where it eased into orbit on Sunday. (See stunning pictures of Saturn.)\n\nVesta's tiny size (on a cosmic scale, at least) means that it has an equally tiny gravitational pull \u0097 about 2% that of Earth's. Settling into orbit thus did not require Dawn to execute a long and powerful burn of a traditional chemical engine. Instead, the ship uses far more subtle ion propulsion, a system in which xenon ions are electrically accelerated, creating an exhaust 10 times faster than what a conventional engine produces. The hitch is, the ion stream is so thin that the overall thrust it produces is only about 91 millinewtons. How weak is that? Pick up a piece of paper and try to feel the gravity pulling it downward; that's 91 millinewtons. Still, since the ion engines are burned and steered almost continuously throughout the mission, the thrust accumulates, ultimately exceeding that of the Delta booster that got Dawn off the pad in the first place.\n\nDuring the year the spacecraft will spend orbiting Vesta, it will study the asteroid with a cluster of instruments including two visual cameras equipped with seven color filters, a visible and infrared mapping spectrometer that will reveal the makeup of the surface of Vesta and a gamma ray and neutron detector that will conduct similar analyses to a depth of 3 ft. (1 m). (See pictures of the sun in 3-D.)\n\nWhen its time at Vesta is over, Dawn will fire up its ion engines, puff its way out of orbit and point its prow toward Ceres, a spherical asteroid that is the largest in the solar system \u0097 606 miles (909 km) across, or about the size of Texas. Ceres is thought to have a layered interior like Earth's and may be up to 25% water \u0097 a suspicion the subsurface gamma ray and neutron detector may at last confirm. Dawn will arrive at Ceres in February 2015 and study the little world for five months, finally ending its mission that July.\n\nThe pictures and data that Dawn returns may never dazzle the public the way the Hubble Telescope's great portraits of the cosmos have. We'll have to settle instead for learning a lot more than we ever knew about the origins of our solar system \u0097 and thus of ourselves. Not a bad eight-year mission for a spaceship that many people never even knew existed.\n\nSee 50 space-race highs and lows.\n\nSee the world's most influential people in the 2011 TIME 100.", "summary": "After a journey of four years, the Dawn probe reaches Vesta", "compression": 75.5833333333, "coverage": 0.75, "density": 0.9166666667, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

But he is also doing a lot of other things, as well. He is promoting the second grand opening of his new Washington D.C. hotel Wednesday, and on Tuesday he showcased his Doral golf resort in Florida, gathering cameras to photograph all his employees. \u201cWe\u2019re at Trump National Doral,\u201d he told the national press, less than three weeks before the election. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great places on earth.\u201d\n\nOn the stump, he has begun delivering alternative news reports at the start of his speeches, laying out the latest scandals that he sees the mainstream news media ignoring before he describes his plans for the future. And in a possible preview of a news venture if he loses, he has asked his staff to launch a new nightly news show on Facebook to broadcast this different view about what is happening in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely winning,\u201d Trump surrogate Boris Epshteyn announced on the first show Monday night, despite the fact that public polling and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway show Trump trailing.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re ahead of where we\u2019ve ever been before, and we think we\u2019re ahead of them,\u201d followed Sean Spicer said Monday night of the GOP ground-game. Democrats have a 4-1 staff advantage over Republicans across battleground states.\n\nThe shift in strategy is unconventional, but it fits a pattern for Trump, who has always combined promoting his own businesses with his political ambitions. But the strategic moves come at a time when the campaign is not exactly hiding internal differences over the direction of the campaign. \u201cDonald Trump is at his very best, at his very best, when he talks about the issues,\u201d Conway told CNN for a profile broadcast on Tuesday.\n\nAfter an event on Saturday, Conway said she confronted Trump for going off script at a rally, suggesting he was sabotaging his own chances for the White House. \u201cYou and I are in a fight for the next 17 days,\u201d Conway said she told him. \u201cBecause I know you\u2019re going to win. And that comment you just made sounds like you think you\u2019re going to lose. And we\u2019re going to argue about it until you win.\u201d\n\nTrump has never taken easily to such staff direction, and there are clear signs that he has become more comfortable in recent weeks charting his own course away from the issues, towards the airing of grievances, including attacks on the media and Clinton. After nearly a dozen women came forward to accuse him of sexual impropriety or assault, he launched an aggressive new message, arguing that there was a conspiracy of globalists, the Clinton campaign and the media to elect his opponent. Republican strategists have privately complained that this is a message aimed not at people he needs to win, but at those die-hard supporters who attend his rallies.\n\nThe nightly video show on Facebook is another enterprise that seems aimed primarily at those voters who have already decided they will support Trump. The nightly program launched Monday, just over two weeks before Election Day. It continued Tuesday, after his evening rally.\n\nStarring the three-piece -suit-clad Epshteyn, a former junior advisor to John McCain, and Cliff Sims, the publisher of conservative website Yallowhammer News, Trump Live appears to represent the proof of concept for the long-rumored Trump Television network.\n\nThe show offered anti-Clinton polemics by the likes of Rudy Giuliani and 24-year-old Blaze TV host Tomi Lahren. For those not already versed in the language and arguments of the conservative press, the barrier for entry for engaging with the show would likely have seemed high. On the inaugural episode, Epshetyn compared the Democratic nominee to a mob boss.\n\nBeyond the ad-hominem attacks, Trump Live is one of the last bastions of optimism for the Republican nominee, despite overwhelming polling data showing his struggles. At times, it even seemed like the show was acknowledging Trump\u2019s coming defeat. \u201cWe\u2019re basically electing a criminal,\u201d said former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the Tuesday broadcast.\n\nAdvised by former Fox News boss Roger Ailes and Breitbart News CEO Stephen Bannon, Trump and his aides have held multiple conversations about a future media empire for the bombastic nominee over the last several months. If the Facebook live stream viewership is any indication, may struggle to build an audience. A peak of 60,000 tuned in live on the first night, but quickly fell to under 50,000. On the second night, only about 30,000 people watched live. (The first stream, which included footage of Trump\u2019s rally in St. Augustine, Fla. was viewed 1.4 million times over the subsequent 24 hours, according to Facebook.)\n\nTrump, at least publicly, has denied an interest in a media empire, telling a Ohio radio station Tuesday, \u201cNo, I have no interest in Trump TV,\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean a core base of Trump supporters are unwilling to watch. Indeed, the broadcasts so far have been full of surprises. After a brief blackout due to a \u201csetting configuration\u201d error on Trump\u2019s end Tuesday night, an unseen producer marveled to the hosts: \u201cThey\u2019re blaming Facebook,\u201d he said, \u201csaying it\u2019s a conspiracy.\u201d", "summary": "An unconventional campaign stays off script in final weeks", "compression": 113.7777777778, "coverage": 0.7777777778, "density": 1.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The organization has fewer than 1,000 paid-up members according to the U.K. antifascist group Hope Not Hate. Its views lie so close to the outer-right edge of the political spectrum that Britain First\u2019s co-founder and self-styled leader, Paul Golding, describes the U.K.\u2019s governing Conservative party as \u201cleft wing.\u201d Nevertheless he rejects a \u201cfar right\u201d label. \u201cWe deal in right and wrong,\u201d Golding says, and he and his deputy Jayda Fransen go on to prove the second half of that sentence during a lengthy conversation with TIME at a hotel in Dartford, southeast of London.\n\nYet the doll\u2019s-sized political organization with an extra-large capacity for unintentional comedy has a surprisingly pervasive online presence. If you frequent Facebook, you may well have browsed material posted by Britain First. Perhaps you \u201cliked\u201d or shared Britain First\u2019s posts. That would put you in broad and \u2014 if you do not subscribe to Britain First\u2019s politics \u2014 befuddled company. Some 22.5 million Facebook users in the U.K. and 43.7 million in the U.S. interacted with Britain First last month. \u201cEven my mother has posted stuff from Britain First on her Facebook page,\u201d says Hope Not Hate\u2019s Matthew Collins, who has written a research paper on the group.\n\nSome of my friends have made the same mistake, liberals and feminists who would in other circumstances recoil from Britain First\u2019s patented brew of Bible-quoting, fear-mongering, foam-flecked foreigner bating and probably wouldn\u2019t be any happier to learn that the online savvy that snared them was honed in the service of U.S. anti-abortion campaigns. Several such friends were among the 273,979 Facebook users to repost a Britain First item earlier this year that purported to show \u201cMuslim girls being lead [sic] off in chains to meet their new husbands\u201d. It would have required only a minute or two on Google to establish that the image had been taken from a passion play staged to mark the Shi\u2019ite festival of Ashura. Still, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the social media platforms that Islamist jihadists are becoming increasingly expert at using to recruit and propagandize should also become the vehicle of an Islamophobic backlash. In both cases, the toxic messages are spread not only by their originators but by innocent dupes.\n\nTo understand how this works and to get a clear-eyed view of the nature and aims of Britain First, I asked Golding and Fransen for an interview. This took place on Oct. 31 and at first glance it would have been easy to mistake the pair for trick-or-treaters. They and their burly, shaven-headed bodyguard sport matching clothing from Britain First\u2019s own range of leisure wear-cum-battle fatigues emblazoned with a lion, a union flag and the slogan \u201ctaking our country back.\u201d Confusingly, it turns out that Britain First aims to take back more than one country. Golding is in the process of launching America First, a movement aiming to reclaim the U.S., undeterred by the fact he has never visited the U.S. or by the inconvenient fact that the U.S. already boasts a political party called America First, established in 2002 \u201cto put America and all Americans first.\u201d \u201cWe have no connection with Britain First and no one from that group has contacted me,\u201d emails Jon Hill, national chairman of the American America First.\n\nBritain First\u2019s America First Facebook page went live on Nov. 3 and this is where any comedy starts to curdle. As of Nov. 6 the new page already had more than 6,000 likes. Its content is similar to the original Britain First site, an inchoate mix of patriotism, Christian imagery and repurposed content from other pages, much of it inviting clicks and shares: \u201cShare if you\u2019re a warrior for Christ\u201d; \u201cLike if you agree: We cannot forget our veterans\u201d; \u201cClint Eastwood says \u2018Obama is a fraud\u2019. Do you agree?\u201d\n\nWell known figures often appear on Britain First\u2019s Facebook page\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Winston Churchill, the Queen. It\u2019s safe to assume Her Majesty\u2019s endorsement hasn\u2019t been sought. A post featuring the British comic actor Rowan Atkinson\u2014best known as the bumbling \u201cMr Bean\u201d\u2014carries a quotation from a speech he made to the House of Lords in 2005, in opposition to a badly drawn piece of proposed legislation that risked criminalizing mockery of religions. \u201cWhat is wrong with encouraging intense dislike of a religion? Why shouldn\u2019t you do that, if the beliefs of that religion or the activities perpetrated in its name deserve to be intensely disliked?\u201d Atkinson asked. Of the nearly 5,000 people who \u201cliked\u201d the post, at least some will have assumed Atkinson\u2019s words to be directed against Islam.\n\nBritain First posts frequently on Facebook and its own website, often with a spin on breaking news and a good sense of what may go viral. Hope Not Hate\u2019s Collins ascribes slickness of the operation to Britain First co-founder Jim Dowson, a Briton with marketing skills polished during time spent promoting U.S. anti-abortion groups and also helping to build up the British National Party, a predecessor to Britain First that at its 2009 peak attracted almost a million votes in the European elections. Dowson quit Britain First in July but Golding and his group continue to carry out the online model he established.\n\nThere\u2019s little apart from bad punctuation to indicate the gulf between that online presence and the real-world reality: that Britain First are the accident-prone Mr. and Mrs. Beans of the U.K.\u2019s radical political fringes. When the broadcaster Channel 4 shadowed the group, the Britain First Land Rover, theatrically decked in military camouflage, took too speedy a turn into a car park, snapping off the barrier.\n\nDemocratic politics both sides of the Atlantic is \u201ca big, giant, meaningless circus\u201d in Golding\u2019s phrase, yet Fransen is standing as Britain First\u2019s candidate in a U.K. Nov. 20 parliamentary by-election caused by the defection of a sitting MP\u2014the appropriately named Mark Reckless\u2014from the Conservative party to the euroskeptic United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP. Fransen\u2019s message to voters is not what you might expect. \u201cVote for UKIP,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause we fully support them.\u201d\n\nIf UKIP is queasy about that support\u2014characterizing a photograph of one of its campaigners posing chummily with Fransen as an \u201cambush\u201d\u2014that\u2019s not surprising. Britain First translates the anti-immigrant rhetoric of UKIP into direct and unpleasant action, participating in so-called \u201cChristian patrols\u201d through areas with significant Muslim populations and staging \u201cmosque invasions.\u201d In May, Golding and four companions barged into the East London Mosque, trampling across prayer mats in their street shoes and demanding to see the imam. \u201cThey left in a hurry because there was a traffic warden,\u201d says Salman Farsi, who witnessed the incursion. \u201cHe\u2019d pulled up outside to their car and was about to issue a ticket.\u201d\n\nThat may seem pretty funny but, says Farsi, \u201cthe community is fearful of individuals like this.\u201d Collins suggests the greater risk comes not from Britain First but the responses the group may provoke: \u201cI think they are very very dangerous. Not in the way they would probably like me to say but they are capable of causing a reaction from the people they\u2019re harassing, which would totally outstrip what Britain First is doing.\u201d In May, Britain First surrounded the home of a controversial preacher Anjem Choudary, the former British head of the now banned Islamist group al-Muhajiroun. The British authorities evacuated Choudary and his family. Collins worries that Britain First, far from containing radical Islam, \u201cis acting as a catalyst and recruiting agent for these people.\u201d\n\nThe brutal murder in 2013 of off-duty soldier Lee Rigby in London by two assailants, one with links to al-Muhajiroun, certainly helped to kindle the sorts of fears and prejudices towards Muslims that Britain First seeks to exploit. Rigby\u2019s family complained after Britain First co-opted Rigby\u2019s name during the May 2014 European elections, registering the slogan \u201cRemember Lee Rigby.\u201d The U.K. Electoral Commission apologized.\n\nTowards the end of TIME\u2019s conversation with Golding and Fransen, a man who has come to the hotel to use the gym facilities recognizes the Britain First leadership. \u201cWhat do you stand for?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe\u2019re pro-British, we don\u2019t like political correctness, we want our own people put first in our own country, we don\u2019t want mass immigration,\u201d summarizes Golding.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean immigrants have to leave then?

Back in October 2007, the same month that Radiohead sent out its pay-whatever-you-please release In Rainbows, a shaggy-haired Midwesterner by the name of Justin Vernon was quietly self-releasing the moody, meditative record For Emma, Forever Ago. The album was recorded chiefly over a single lonely winter in a snowbound cabin in northwestern Wisconsin, and fans of those early self-leaked tracks were wooed by Emma's expansive, ethereal atmosphere. Playing with ambiguous (some might say unintelligible) lyrics and manipulating Auto-Tune to distort and reinvent the conventional singer-songwriter textures, Vernon produced a haunting Rorschach test of an album, a tribute to the fragile, fractured despair of the deepest heartache. Vernon's voice, a creamy falsetto, was the record's most distinctive element, but the closer one listened to the tracks, the more the meticulous, daring production design came into focus. For Emma earned a rave Pitchfork review and then sent print critics swooning; not long after, indie label Jagjaguwar picked up the record for a proper release. (See TIME's guide to the best music of this summer.)\n\nFans have been waiting for a second album ever since. Between 2008 and 2011, Vernon went from hermit to headliner, signing up for an array of collaborations (Volcano Choir, Gayngs) before hopping into a recording booth with Kanye West. As Vernon has skewed more mainstream, many early Bon Iver fans began to wonder, Was For Emma a momentary aberration? The answer comes in the form of Bon Iver, Bon Iver, the band's impressive new effort, which is already widely available for Web streaming (it officially goes on sale Tuesday, June 21).\n\nMost startling about the new tracks is the band's refined ensemble sound. Ditching the acoustic solitude, Vernon has marshaled a considerable company of musicians (his summer tour is featuring an eight-piece band) to add texture to his familiar sounds of isolation, accenting his contemplation with an array of horns, strings, organs and soaring electric guitars. A first spin through the songs, carefully curated to create an emotional progression, reveals the poignant peaks and troughs \u0097 the bombastic horns of \"Perth,\" the delicate howls of \"Holocene,\" the electronic pulses of \"Hinnom, TX\" and the delicate piano-and-strings requiem of \"Wash.\" (See the All-TIME 100 albums.)\n\nBut much like For Emma, the more you listen, the deeper and broader the songs become. (I've hit repeat about 20 times now and continue to discover new details buried in the compositions.) \"Perth,\" the record's opening track\u0097 each song bears a geographic label \u0097 swiftly bridges the ethereal For Emma and the more earthbound Bon Iver. A gust of wind, a flurry of clanging (are those wind chimes?) and a faded, echoed chorus of voices are abruptly joined by snare drums moving at a swift march. The pace quickens, the voices come to the foreground, the horns chime in, and \"Perth\" builds into a triumphant, celebratory crescendo. If the earlier Bon Iver record looked inward, inviting listeners to journey inside a wounded heart, \"Perth\" makes it clear: this is an album that aims to shout from the rooftops. The snow has thawed.\n\nThe risk that accompanies this amplified approach is that this new, plugged-in sound will strip the band of its evocative ambiance. What was most distinctive, and enjoyable, about Bon Iver's free-floating debut was the stark lack of elements at play, the open space that accented all that heartache. Indeed, there is one track on Bon Iver in which one can feel the pitfalls of all this new pep as the walls close in. It's a bouncy, three-minute track dubbed \"Towers,\" so breezy with twangy electric guitar, popping horns and bubble-gum choruses (\"Whoa whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa\") that it all but flies in one ear and out the other. Of all the Bon Iver tracks yet created, this is the most sparkling, syncopated and thoroughly forgettable.\n\nBut the \"Towers\" misstep is a revealing outlier, underscoring just how effectively Bon Iver have made use of these new musical tools on the other tracks, molding songs of greater intricacy and complexity. The euphoric \"Perth\" segues seamlessly into the sprawling, seductive \"Minnesota, WI,\" on which Vernon alternates between a flowing baritone and a more staccato falsetto (\"Never gonna break, never gonna break\"), just as the music veers from a bouncy electronic march to a static organ to an urgent duet between a plucky acoustic guitar and two swinging saxophones. Fans will fall in love immediately with \"Holocene,\" a faint, solo guitar melody that would have fit perfectly on For Emma, building to a chorus that is at once reflective and mournful: \"And at once I knew I was not magnificent/ High above the jagged aisle/ Jagged vacance, thick with ice/ I could see for miles, miles, miles.\" The heartstrings pull tightest on \"Wash.,\" whose cascade of male harmonies floats somewhere between the warmth of the violins and the chilly syncopation of the piano. (Watch \"5 Ways to Play a Music Festival.\")\n\nIt's near the end of the record that one feels Vernon eagerly pushing the envelope. The hypnotic \"Hinnom, TX\" features so much electronic manipulation in its pulsating guitars (and multilayered voices) that it could easily be mistaken for a TV on the Radio soundscape; \"Calgary\" has already earned comparisons to Coldplay with its soft-rock hum. Critics and fans alike, however, have gasped at the finale: the Bruce Hornsby love letter \"Beth/Rest,\" easily the most polarizing Bon Iver, Bon Iver track. Swelling organs slide abruptly into electric guitar and screeching sax, evoking an anthem right out of the '80s. It's more than just playfully retro; this is Vernon's unabashed love letter to his musical comfort food.\n\nFor some, \"Beth/Rest\" will be too much: too earnest, too sappy. But it's really no more audacious in concept than \"Perth\" or \"Holocene.\" All richly layered tapestries anchored by lush vocals, inviting and mysterious lyrics, expert production and an overwhelming sense of longing, the songs of Bon Iver, Bon Iver exceed those of For Emma in nearly every capacity. Yes, those initial cabin melodies had the benefit of novelty and distinctiveness, but these new creations look further and plunge deeper, exploring a much more diverse emotional terrain. And structural analysis aside, one shouldn't waste time scrutinizing the obvious \u0097 that cuts like \"Beth/Rest,\" \"Wash.,\" \"Holocene\" and \"Perth\" rise atop heartfelt and elegant melodies, arriving at achingly beautiful pinnacles. Even with all the new tools on display, there's still the magic of twilight emanating from Bon Iver, Bon Iver. The difference is that now it feels more like sunrise than sunset, as if we're connecting with a musician no longer haunted by what he lost but instead tantalized by what comes next.\n\nSee the best albums of the 2000s.\n\nSee how Bon Iver's influence is heard on Kanye West's newest album.", "summary": "Fans have been dreaming for years for a follow-up to Bon Iver's virtuosic neo-folk record For Emma, Forever Ago.

Eight years later, the barricades remain. It was a phony issue, of course \u0097 just another stick with which to beat Bill Clinton, who closed the road at the insistence of the Secret Service. In an interview with PBS a month after Sept. 11, 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney stated the obvious: \"Pennsylvania Avenue ought to stay closed because, as a fact, if somebody were to detonate a truck bomb in front of the White House, it would probably level the White House, and that is unacceptable.\"\n\nSept. 11 is the excuse for many of the Bush Administration's failures and disappointments. It is also the basis for the one great claim made on George W. Bush's behalf: At least he has protected us from terrorism. In the seven years since that day, there has not been another foreign-terrorist attack on the American homeland. The trouble is that there were no foreign-terrorist attacks on the American homeland in the seven years before 9/11 either. The risk of another terrorist attack didn't increase on 9/11 \u0097 only our awareness of the risk. The Bush Administration took office mocking the concern that someone might blow up the White House but soon enough was echoing that concern. (See pictures of the White House.)\n\nThe platform on which Bush entered the presidency eight years ago comes from a lost world, in which even the party out of power saw an America of unthreatened prosperity and security. \"Yesterday's wildest dreams are today's realities, and there is no limit on the promise of tomorrow,\" the GOP said. The biggest foreign policy challenge America faced in 2000, according to this party document, was to avoid misusing our enormous power. \"Earlier generations defended America through great trials,\" the platform declared. Then it quoted the Republican nominee, Bush, on the importance of showing the \"modesty of true strength. The humility of real greatness.\" Even enthusiasts of Bush's foreign policy would not describe it as displaying the humility of true greatness. More like the pugnacity of lost greatness. All that talk of one superpower \u0097 us \u0097 bestriding a \"unipolar\" world seems as dated as Seinfeld reruns.\n\nThe measure of Bush's failure as President is not his broken promises or unmet goals. All politicians break their promises, and none achieve the goals of their soaring rhetoric. But Bush stands out for abandoning the promises and goals that got him elected, taking up the opposite ones and then failing to keep or meet those.\n\nIn 2000 Bush excoriated his predecessor for launching wars without an \"exit strategy.\" In 2008 he leaves his successor a war that has already lasted for years longer than America's involvement in World War II, with no exit in sight. Bush got elected warning against using U.S. troops for \"nation-building\" \u0097 meaning any goal beyond immediate military necessity. Then once in office, he promised to bring democracy to the entire Middle East and ended up destroying Iraq as a nation in the name of saving it.\n\nBush leaves the stage still justifying his Iraq disaster on the grounds that prewar intelligence showed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He acknowledges that this intelligence was wrong but maintains he relied on it in good faith. Who cares? What matters is whether there were WMD, not how sincerely he believed there were. WMD were how he justified the war. How do you explain to families of the war dead why a war must go on for years after even the man who started it thinks starting it was based on a mistake?\n\nThe current economic calamity was a bolt from the blue to many who should have known better, but only one of them had been in charge for the previous eight years. Only one spent much of that time bragging about how swell everything was, thanks to him. Many shared the heedless assumption that there was no limit on how much government or individuals could borrow, but only one turned record surpluses into record deficits. And only one lectured us, Reagan-style, about burdensome government and then, almost casually, expanded government's role in the economy more than any President since F.D.R.: taking over banks and bailing out the auto companies.\n\nO.K., but didn't he do anything right? Well, he came up with serious money to treat AIDS and malaria in Africa. He used the bully pulpit to embrace Muslims in the great post-9/11 American bear hug, when there was real danger of the opposite reaction. And you could say that Bush's disastrous presidency vindicates democracy. Let's not forget that, in 2000, more people voted for the other guy.\n\nSee TIME's Person of the Year, People Who Mattered and more.\n\nSee pictures of Barack Obama's nation of hope.", "summary": "The Bush presidency stands for failure at home and abroad \u0097 and an ultimate vindication of democracy", "compression": 55.4117647059, "coverage": 0.7647058824, "density": 0.8823529412, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

A billionaire who made his money in the credit card business, Pi\u00f1era served as president from 2010 to 2014, and he reflected on the defeat of his party after he stepped down, limited by law to one term. His center-right government had presided over an economic boom, with growth averaging 6 percent, yet his party was driven from power amid street protests against rising inequality. Supporters of the new president, Michele Bachelet, had promised to \u201ctake a bulldozer\u201d to the Chilean model of lean government and low taxes. As we spoke, they were pushing for a bigger government, higher spending to help the poor and higher corporate taxes to pay for free university education. Chile\u2019s shift under Bachelet reflected \u201cthe long history of Latin America,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said, with only a hint of frustration. \u201cWhen times are good, countries turn to the left, and when times are bad, they turn to the right.\u201d\n\nRead More: These 5 Facts Explain Why Venezuela Could Be on the Brink of Collapse\n\nIt was only a few months later that Latin voters soon started to reverse the \u201cpink tide,\u201d which had seen a range of bright to light-red socialists rise to power in a dozen Latin countries, from Argentina to Chile, in the previous decade. The pink tide was supported by good times, as high global prices for commodity exports\u2014soybeans in Brazil, oil and gas in Bolivia and Ecuador, copper in Peru and Chile\u2014allowed socialist governments to support generous welfare spending. In 2015, however, as commodity prices plunged to multi-year lows, hard times came back with a vengeance in Latin America. Regionwide, economic growth turned negative, and inflation hit 15 percent, its highest since the currency crises of the 1990s.\n\nThe worst economic environment in a generation led to the fall of one left-wing government after another. The cascade began last November in Argentina, where zero growth and 25 percent inflation set the stage for the defeat of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her populist party. A month later in Venezuela, with inflation in triple digits, the opposition wrestled the national assembly majority away from the socialist ruling party, and pushed for a recall vote to depose President Nicolas Maduro. Approval ratings plummeted for once popular socialists like Bachelet and Ecuador\u2019s Rafael Correa, who announced he would not run for a third term.\n\nRead More: 125 Health Experts Call to Relocate Brazil Olympics Over Zika Fears\n\nSoon after, the diehard anti-imperialist Evo Morales lost a referendum seeking the constitutional right to run for a fourth term in Bolivia. The next domino to fall was Brazil, where average incomes have contracted more sharply in the last two years than during the entire \u201clost decade\u201d of the 1980s, and popular disgust helped fuel the removal by impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party. And in Peru, voters bounced the ruling leftist party before the final round of the presidential election last Sunday, which ended too close to call, but with a slight lead for former prime minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a center-right veteran of Wall Street, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe retreat of the left has triggered an intense debate in Latin America. Some experts highlight economic failures like overdependence on commodities and income inequality, others cultural failures like corruption in Brazil and Chile or the paternity scandal dogging Morales in Bolivia, still others the ideological excesses of zealots like Maduro, or their enemies. Morales recently joined with Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro in blaming American machinations for the string of leftwing defeats, and calling for a counter-revolution to save socialism in Latin America.\n\nRead More: Brazil\u2019s Senate Votes to Impeach President Dilma Rousseff: What Happens Now?\n\nWithout denying that specifically Latin factors are at play, I would suggest an explanation that puts the fall of the Latin left in a larger global and historical context. In my new book, The Rise and Fall of Nations, I narrow the many factors that can shape a nation\u2019s destiny to the ten that matter most, based on a 25 year career as an author and global investor, studying historical patterns. In politics, the rhythm of nations follows a cycle that mimics the circle of life: crisis gives birth to reform, which triggers a boom in growth, which inspires a middle-age complacency, which kills reform and leads to a new crisis. The bigger the crisis, the more likely the nation will seek to topple old leaders and embrace newcomers who promise change. Since 2008\u2014the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s\u2014the world has been in the grip of a revolt against seated rulers. In Latin America, most of them just happened to be left-leaning.\n\nBefore the 2008 crisis, the global economy was booming, and incumbents were winning two out of three elections in the world\u2019s major democracies. Since then, the incumbent parties have been losing as many as two out of three. The revolt continues boiling away because many economies have yet to recover from the crisis, and some\u2014including those in Latin America\u2014are only now seeing the worst of it. The revolt intensified last year, when eight populous democracies held elections. The challengers won five, from Nigeria to Poland and Argentina, and weakened the incumbent majority in two others. The fall of the left in Latin America is a microcosm of the global revolt that aims to throw the bums out.\n\nIt is in part anti-left, but its gut is anti-establishment. The common thread, from Venezuela to Argentina, is sinking economic growth, soaring inflation and stale regimes\u2014ruling parties that had been in power much too long. Morales\u2019s party had ruled for 10 years, Kirchner\u2019s for 12 years, Rousseff\u2019s for 13, Maduro\u2019s for 17. Even the most promising leaders tend to grow complacent with time, running out of ideas and will to reform.\n\nConsider how the circle turned in Brazil, the region\u2019s largest economy. The Workers\u2019 Party came to power in 2002, and for much of the decade presided over a run of reasonably strong growth, with President Lula in office. His government funneled the profits of the commodity price boom into successful welfare programs that eased poverty and built the middle class. But Lula also understood that inflation had toppled many of his predecessors, and his government maintained a steady budget surplus to contain that threat.\n\nIn his later years, however, Lula started showing the usual symptoms of complacency and excessive self-regard. In 2009, when the global financial crisis was devastating many Western nations but not yet the emerging nations, Lula began to crow about how well Brazil was doing. When Rousseff succeeded Lula as his handpicked Workers Party successor in 2010, she kept doing what he had been doing, even further increasing government spending, though the global economic backdrop was changing dramatically. Rousseff funneled more money into welfare programs, though revenue from commodity exports had started to collapse, and the budget fell deep into the red. Desperate to fight the downturn, she ordered state banks to increase lending, and their share of total lending exploded from 34 percent to nearly 60 percent.\n\nUnder Rousseff the welfare state continued to grow and Brazilian government spending now amounts to 40 percent of GDP, a scale on par with much richer nations in Europe. This is an indulgence that no poor nation can afford and it is retarding economic growth. Inflation has returned, and the average Brazilian income has fallen to $8,000, down from $13,000 in 2011. Brazilians started marching by the millions against Rousseff and the entire political establishment as early as 2013, and her impeachment, though technically based on her alleged manipulation of the state banks, just put a bow on the growing package of grievances.\n\nTo be fair, Brazil\u2019s underlying pathologies predate Rousseff, whose main sin was to make them worse. Even under Lula, Brazil did nothing to diversify its economy away from commodities like soybeans, which now account for two thirds of exports, up from less than half in 2000. The addiction to windfall commodity profits is at the heart of the \u201ccar wash\u201d investigation now roiling Brazil\u2019s elite, which involves money allegedly funneled from the state oil company, Petrobras, to leading politicians. Even Lula, who left office a national hero, is now a suspect. But the basic problem of commodity dependence was weighing on Brazil long before Lula, indeed long before the Workers Party was founded, back in 1980.\n\nIn fact no Brazilian leader has done much to address it. Since 1914, Brazil\u2019s economy has always risen and fallen closely in line with global commodity prices, which went through boom and bust spurts but remained essentially flat over that entire period. The result is that Brazil today is as poor relative to United States as it was a hundred years ago. This is how the circle of life turns, lurching from crisis to crisis, dust to dust, leaving many countries stuck in place. For Brazil to break out of this static pattern would take the rise of an unprecedented reformer, a Deng Xiaoping of Latin America.\n\nThis, then, is a fateful moment. In the wake of a crisis as large as 2008, nations come to a fork in the road. Some choose the path of reform, others fall for populist demagogues. The crises of the 1930s brought to power reformers like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and demagogues like Adolf Hitler, a pattern that has played out many times since. In response to the currency crises of the 1990s, for example, Venezuela turned to Hugo Chavez and his \u201c21st Century Socialism,\u201d under which Venezuelan incomes continued a half-century of decline. Others turned to reformers. Brazil elected Lula, who at least exercised budget discipline for a while, and Colombia elected \u00c1lvaro Uribe, a right-wing populist who not only put the books in order but also managed to quell the guerrilla uprisings that had been the chief obstacle to growth in the economy.\n\nToday the world is at a similar post-crisis decision point, with a choice between reformers and a rising cast of angry populists. Compared to Latin America, the United States and parts of Europe are in better economic shape. Surprisingly though, some of these countries are leaning toward neither reformers nor establishment figures but to angry populists. Simmering frustrations over stagnant wages, a fear of immigrants stealing jobs and foreign competition is helping to fuel the rise of populists like Donald Trump. In Europe, the angry right took over the government in Poland last year, and nearly took the presidency in Austria last month. So far the center has held, but in Britain, France, and Germany, the far right parties have grown from marginal to less marginal. These parties are often led by flamboyant Trump-like characters, and the attention they draw has overshadowed the rise of reformers, like Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy.\n\nWhile Latin America is plagued by more severe economic problems, on the political front the news is more encouraging. In Argentina, after last November\u2019s landmark election, Mauricio Macri got started with big bang reforms. He lifted capital controls, removed tariffs on farm exports, and eased subsidies on power and water. Macri brought in a new chief for the central bank and vowed to restore its independence, which is critical for the fight against inflation. He fired government statisticians who had been accused by the IMF and others of cooking Argentina\u2019s economic data, and settled nearly $10 billion in unpaid debts, lifting Argentina out of default and restoring its access to global credit markets after 15 years in the wilderness.\n\nFrom Argentina to Peru and Brazil, the business communities are celebrating the arrival of new governments. This is good news because they are in the main pragmatic reformers and not angry populists. Kucyzinski is a low-key former finance minister who has promised to rule by consensus, clean up corruption and revive growth. Rousseff was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. Though dogged by low popularity ratings himself, Temer came in talking a good reform game and appointing competent aides, and is seen as a stabilizing transition figure as Brazil moves on to new elections in 2018. The people, and the markets, are relieved that Rousseff has been thrown out.\n\nIt is too early to say whether any member of this post-crisis generation will be remembered as a success, because good policy needs a boost from good luck. Today, all the newcomers have the bad luck of arriving amid the weakest global recovery in post-war history, and face the challenge of reviving domestic growth in these difficult conditions. Still, the fortunes of a nation are most likely to turn for the better when a new leader rises in the wake of a crisis, and today voters are throwing the bums out all over the world. That is a promising shift in the circle of life, particularly in Latin America.\n\nSharma is chief global strategist and head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Jimmy Fallon\u2019s lip-synch battle with Emma Stone\n\nThis very spirited musical face-off managed to rack up more than 38 million views.\n\n2. Celebrities read mean tweets about themselves\n\nIn the seventh installment of Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s popular segment, we saw celebs like Sofia Vergara and Don Cheadle read nasty tweets about themselves \u2014 and the video ended up garnering 33.5 million hits.\n\n3. Daniel Radcliffe raps Blackalicious\u2019s \u201cAlphabet Aerobics\u201d\n\nThis clip, which earned 31.6 million views, showed off the surprising (and rather impressive) rap skills of Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe.\n\n4.

Jimmy Fallon and Kevin Hart ride a rollercoaster\n\nWhile hanging out at Universal Orlando Resort, Jimmy Fallon challenged Kevin Hart to conquer one of his fears: roller coasters. Of course, hilarity ensued; the clip got 22.4 million streams.\n\nOkay, so Ellen isn\u2019t technically a late-night show because it airs in the afternoon, but you get the idea. Sia recreated the video for her smash hit \u201cChandelier,\u201d starring then-11-year-old Maddie Ziegler \u2014 and the clip has since racked up 21.5 million views.\n\n10.

Yet they\u2019re some of the least likely Americans to shape the nation\u2019s political future, suggests a new commentary published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s huge influence on health care, doctors vote 9% less than the general population. They\u2019re 22% less likely to cast ballots than lawyers, another group of highly educated professionals.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at the history of the medical profession, there\u2019s the sense that physicians are leaders in their community, and people historically looked up to doctors around broad community issues,\u201d says Dr. David Grande, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the article. But that\u2019s not the case anymore. Their reputation eroded, many experts believe, as they got less time with patients and more and more burned out.\n\nPhysicians give all kinds of reasons for why they don\u2019t cast their ballots in what Grande calls \u201cthe most basic form of public participation.\u201d Often, they don\u2019t have time, or they\u2019re too consumed by work to worry about the world beyond hospital walls. They also might be less engaged in general than other Americans. Physicians volunteer less often than other highly educated and well-compensated people, Grande writes.\n\nJust as troubling is the possibility that some physicians might not know much more than the rest of us when it comes to the inner workings of healthcare. A recent poll found that 40% of graduating medical students thought they didn\u2019t learn enough about health policy.\n\nFortunately, doctors are susceptible to the same psychological tricks as the rest of us, even on Election Day. \u201cThere are a lot of ways in which our behavior is influenced by the people around us, and campaigns have figured this out,\u201d Grande says. \u201cIt makes people more likely to vote if their friends voted.\u201d Medical schools, hospitals and other health care employers should encourage voting by making it more visible and sharing information about early voting.\n\nYou, too, can play a part on Election Day if you\u2019re visiting the doctor.
