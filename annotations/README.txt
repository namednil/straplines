On the top level, the folders ML and WL correspond to two annotators, and the subfolders "1" and "2" correspond to the two annotation rounds respectively.

The data in those folders comes from the time.com and New York Times sections of the test set of the Newsroom corpus, and the same articles were annotated by both annotators.

gold_standard contains the annotations on which the two annotators agreed after discussion, which was used to evaluate the strapline detection heuristics.

In addition, the two directories corresponding to the annotators contain the subfolder "dev", which contains some single annotated data for development.
