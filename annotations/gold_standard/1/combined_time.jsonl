The reunion has been an occasion for eager fans to look back at the decade or so during which the band dominated rock, between their start in 1985 and their sort-of end in 1993, when the band didn\u2019t exactly break up but essentially stopped being able to tolerate one another long enough to make a significant amount of music.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nBut their internal disputes weren\u2019t the only source of Guns N\u2019 Roses controversy.

His speech was less a grand intellectual exercise than a political gambit \u2014 meant to stanch a recent torrent of criticism about his foreign policy woes.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working, at least not among the foreign policy elites whose opinions shape broader attitudes.\n\nTake the stink eye Obama drew from the New York Times\u2018s left-leaning editorial page, for example, which said the address \u201cdid not match the hype, was largely uninspiring, lacked strategic sweep and is unlikely to quiet his detractors, on the right or the left.\u201d The Times focused on a non-ideological gripe: that Obama\u2019s specific agenda remains vague, and said he \u201cprovided little new insight into how he plans to lead in the next two years.\u201d But the paper also swiped him from the political left, calling his defense of continued partnership with Egypt\u2019s repressive military regime \u201cdisturbing,\u201d and his claim to support more transparency for counter terror operations like drone strikes and NSA surveillance \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\nAlso unimpressed was the centrist Bloomberg View, which calls Obama\u2019s speech \u201cunlikely to tamp down criticism of his conduct of foreign policy as weak, indecisive and unconvincing,\u201d particularly given, as others complained, \u201cthe mushiness of the initiatives he proposes.\u201d\n\nMore predictable were harsh editorials from the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, both longtime Obama foreign policy critics. A Post editorial complained that Obama offered mere words when new policies are needed, lamenting that his reticence to use force puts him \u201cat odds with every U.S. president since World War II.\u201d The Journal groused (along with many others) that Obama set up a false rhetorical choice between wanton military adventurism and pure isolationism\u2014and it snarked at omissions in the speech, from the failed Middle East peace process to ongoing chemical attacks in Syria.\n\nThe spitballs have come from abroad as well. The London-based Financial Times said the speech \u201chas done little to dispel the suspicion that priorities are shaped more by U.S. politics than facts on the ground.\u201d Chemi Shalev, an editor for the left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz, called the speech \u201clackluster\u201d and said it \u201cfailed to live up to the hype that he would proclaim American training and arms for anti-Assad rebels.\u201d (Obama said only that he would work with Congress to \u201cramp up\u201d support for moderate Syrian rebels.)\n\nAmerican columnists and opinion leaders weren\u2019t much friendlier. Richard Haas, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it \u201cwas more clear what [the speech] was against, than what it was actually for.\u201d Foreign Policy\u2018s David Rothkopf trashed the address as \u201ca dribbler into the glove of the first baseman. It provided neither reassurance to allies nor anything remotely like a foreign-policy vision.\u201d Kathleen Hicks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies lamented that Obama \u201cfailed to tie [his] strategic frame to the underlying funding and hard choices necessary to make it possible.\u201d\n\nNot everyone hated the speech. While conceding that it was \u201cnot exciting,\u201d TIME\u2019s own Joe Klein praised Obama for sticking to his guns\u2014offering his critics words but not a policy shift. The Post\u2018s David Ignatius thinks the president \u201carticulated the right structure for U.S. foreign policy going forward,\u201d though he also frets that Obama\u2019s 2016 exit date from Afghanistan may underestimate the threat of an al-Qaeda resurgence there. Terrorism expert Peter Bergen seems to have found the speech a sensible antidote to Bush-era foreign policy.\n\nStill unclear is the reaction of the audience Obama cares about most of all\u2014the American people. It\u2019s not uncommon for elites to pan a presidential speech that turns out to be a hit in the heartland. With Obama\u2019s foreign policy approval ratings underwater as Democrats head into a daunting midterm election, the White House needs to hope for another case of insider-outsider disconnect.

The former elicited some disappointment, but fans took it in stride; the latter wasn\u2019t quite as well received.\n\nWhatever your opinion, television shows have been killing off significant characters in sudden and violent ways for years, and the practice is only becoming more commonplace. Once upon a time, characters would only die in season finales, once their plot lines had dried up. These days, it\u2019s open season on all but the most essential characters. (And not even those are always safe.)\n\nPerhaps the tide turned when Game of Thrones killed off its main character (or at least the character that all promotional materials would have you believe was the main one), Ned Stark, before the first season had even ended. Up to that point, Thrones had been popular, but that shocking killing helped turn it into a phenomenon. Of course, that\u2019s an easier coup to pull off when a show has a wealth of source material and an enormous cast of compelling characters. But it established the idea that, by and large, audiences like the fact that characters could die at any moment.\n\nNone have managed to quite reach Game of Thrones-level shockery (the Red Wedding indicates that will continue to be the case), but plenty of shows have opted to go ahead and kill prominent characters if the plot required it. Consider the fate of Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt) on Boardwalk Empire: though Steve Buscemi\u2019s Nucky Thompson was certainly the show\u2019s headlining character, Jimmy had been built up as the savvy protagonist who would one day succeed and exceed his mentor \u2014 the character that viewers would rally behind. Turns out, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Jimmy\u2019s betrayal of Nucky led him down an inexorable path to his demise at the end of the show\u2019s second season.\n\nAt the time, many questioned the wisdom of killing off the character with whom audiences most readily identified. But in spite of those reservations, the series has flourished in its subsequent seasons \u2014 with both the show\u2019s characters and its fans relishing a Jimmy-free Boardwalk.\n\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon not unique to Boardwalk: once a character is gone, he\u2019s forgotten and the show goes on without him, as often as not for the better. The handwringing over The Good Wife\u2018s big death may make total sense right now, but if The Wire could survive without Omar and Stringer Bell, or Breaking Bad without Gus Fring and Hank Schrader, it\u2019s a good bet that things will turn out just fine for fans.

At the focal point of Egypt\u2019s upheavals, where authorities had hoped to stage celebrations, there was instead a prayer for the week\u2019s dead, including soldiers cut down by militants in Sinai and the country\u2019s chief prosecutor, assassinated by car bomb in the capital.\n\nA sense of foreboding fills the air, with officials and media speaking of a state of war and urging national unity. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has promised swift justice, which critics fear will mean a further step away from democracy. The Muslim Brotherhood, banned but unbowed, has upped the ante by calling for revolt against his rule. There is fear of even worse attacks of the kind that have become sadly familiar around the region.\n\nIt all presents a major challenge for el-Sissi, who as army chief led the takeover against Morsi two years ago, when millions filled the streets outraged over what they saw as Brotherhood misrule. He was later elected president, and the deal he has offered Egyptians \u2014 a curtailing of freedoms in exchange for stability and security \u2014 was one many seemed eagerly willing to embrace after several years of upheaval, in which the wider region has gone up in flames.\n\nThe first part of that equation has been carried out: the once-ruling Muslim Brotherhood has been largely crushed, thousands of its members and scores of leaders in jail and hundreds \u2014 including Morsi \u2014 handed the death penalty. Public protests are restricted, as is political activity. The media has been cowed amid an atmosphere that seems to equate criticism with disloyalty, and even many liberal activists are in jail. The result has been quieter streets, without protests that often turned to riots the past three years, and violence against Christian and Shiite minorities has lessened, though not stopped.\n\nBut stability, which for a time seemed attainable, seems to be in danger of unraveling. Militants affiliated with the regional Islamic State group have turned the northern part of the Sinai peninsula into a war zone, this week staging a brazen multi-pronged attack on army positions. Last month a key tourist site at Luxor was attacked, and on Tuesday chief prosecutor Hisham Barakat was assassinated while leaving his Cairo home for work.\n\nIslamic radicals have claimed responsibility for the attacks. Authorities generally blame the Muslim Brotherhood itself, claiming its leaders issue orders from behind bars. Some believe the group\u2019s denials while others don\u2019t, and proof is scarce.\n\nMichael Hanna, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Century Foundation, sees an \u201cescalatory cycle \u2026 deteriorating security is eroding confidence in the capacity of the regime but at the same time also reinforcing hard-line trends in Egyptian society with respect of how to deal with these security threats.\u201d\n\nAfter the killing of Barakat, an angry el-Sissi went on TV to promise more efficient justice. He also suggested that the death penalties against the Islamist leaders would \u2014 contrary to expectations \u2014 actually be carried out.\n\nAction will be taken within days \u201cto enable us to execute the law, and bring justice as soon as possible,\u201d he said. In a thinly veiled reference to jailed members of the Brotherhood, el-Sissi blamed the violence on those \u201cissuing orders from behind bars,\u201d and warned: \u201cIf there is a death sentence, it will be carried out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will stand in the face of the whole world, and fight the whole world,\u201d el-Sissi said.\n\nEl-Sissi was alluding to the widespread global criticism of his heavy-handed rule \u2014 charges certainly also echoed by domestic opponents, not all of them Islamists.\n\nOn Friday, hundreds of mostly young Islamist demonstrators held several small protests in Cairo suburbs, carrying pro-Morsi signs and chanting \u201cdown with military rule.\u201d\n\nBut el-Sissi also has wide support among Egyptians who have come to feel that liberal democracy is a bad fit in a society where almost half the people are illiterate and significant political forces would, if allowed, create a theocracy which would hardly be democratic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s progress and stability, we feel more order in the streets and the economy. But there\u2019s nobody who\u2019s not sad in Egypt these days because of the attacks in Sinai,\u201d said Ibrahim Hamdy, a shopkeeper at a hardware store in a popular neighborhood of central Cairo, where Ramadan decorations hung from the buildings.\n\nThe crackdown on the Brotherhood and other opponents following Morsi\u2019s ouster claimed hundreds of lives and landed thousands in jail. With most of the Brotherhood cadres imprisoned, youth supporters have been left leaderless. Some still protest several times a week in dilapidated Cairo suburbs and narrow alleyways, or restive rural areas off-limits to the state.\n\nUnprecedented, coordinated attacks by militants including massive suicide bombings on the army in the Sinai Peninsula on Wednesday underlined the failure to stem an insurgency that blossomed in the area after Morsi\u2019s overthrow, despite a heavy-handed crackdown.\n\nThe army said 17 soldiers and over 100 militants were killed, although before the release of its official statement, several senior security officials from multiple branches of Egypt\u2019s forces in Sinai had said that scores more troops also died in the fighting. The same day, a special forces raid on a Cairo apartment killed nine leaders of the outlawed Brotherhood, which said they were innocents \u201cmurdered in cold blood,\u201d and called for a \u201crebellion.\u201d\n\nSinai\u2019s main insurgent organization, which calls itself the Sinai Province of the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s assault. El-Sissi has yet to address the public about the attacks, but in the past he has described the Brotherhood as the root of all Islamic extremist groups. Just two days earlier, the assassination of Barakat was claimed by an obscure militant group.\n\nThe week\u2019s events have pushed aside, for now, the talk of Egypt\u2019s budding economic recovery. GDP is accelerating, foreign investment has jumped and the stock market is rising. Unemployment is down and the country\u2019s credit ratings are up. Gas lines are gone and the country has capital to invest, thanks in part to a multi-billion dollar aid package from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAmong Brotherhood\u2019s supporters, calls to abandon non-violence are growing, deepening an internal split over the issue. Wednesday\u2019s call for revolt may reinforce those urging the use of force.\n\nSecurity expert H.A. Hellyer said it was not inevitable but \u201cincreasingly likely\u201d that the call will result in \u201ca more militant and insurgency-style route.\u201d Hellyer, of London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute, said such calls would find \u201ca much more receptive audience against the backdrop of the political realities in Egypt and the crackdown.\u201d\n\nThe events do not bode well for attempts to support democracy, form a more pluralistic society, or even elect a parliament, which el-Sissi had said would come at the end of the year.\n\nThose elections, whenever they take place, are likely to produce a strongly pro-el-Sissi legislature. Islamists, in various forms, may still have a solid base of support but are likely to largely boycott \u2014 something that allowed el-Sissi to easily win election a year ago. The existing non-Islamic parties, an assortment of nationalists and liberals, were disorganized and hapless in opposition to Morsi and largely back el-Sissi now.", "summary": "Mohammed Morsi has since been sentenced to death", "compression": 182.25, "coverage": 0.625, "density": 0.625, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Every inmate lives alone in a 7-ft. by 14-ft. cell that resembles nothing so much as a large, concrete closet, equipped with a sink, a toilet, a desk and a molded stool and sleep platform covered by a thin mattress. The solid metal door is outfitted with strips around the sides and bottom, muffling conversation with inmates in adjacent cells. Three times a day, a tray of food is delivered and is eaten alone. The prisoner may spend 23 hours a day in lockdown, emerging to exercise once a day. The lights in the cell never go off, although they may be dimmed a bit at night.\n\nIf there's not much to like about the conditions in Youngstown, there's not much to like about the people confined there either. These are the men corrections folks like to call \"the worst of the worst,\" the kind of felons who dealt drugs or led gangs or killed on the outside and continued to do so in prison. For them, maximum security would not be enough--only supermax would do. And say what you will about the draconian environment, it keeps them under control.\n\nBut that level of control may be counterproductive. It's possible that the very steps we're taking to keep society safe and such prisoners in check are achieving just the opposite. The U.S. holds about 2 million people under lock and key, and 20,000 of them are confined in the 31 supermaxes operated by the states and the Federal Government. That may represent only 1% of the inmate population, but it's a volatile 1%. Push any punishment too far and mental breakdown--or at least a claim of mental breakdown--is sure to follow. When that happens, a constitutional challenge can't be far behind.\n\nIn December, officials in Texas and California conceded that the suicide rates in their prisons are on the rise, with the majority occurring among inmates in solitary. This prompted an outcry against both systems. Lawyers for accused terrorist facilitator Jose Padilla challenged his fitness last month to stand trial, arguing that his 3\u00bd years in solitary lockdown at a South Carolina military brig have rendered him unable to assist in his own defense. Around the same time, convicted bomber Eric Rudolph began corresponding with a reporter for a Colorado newspaper, describing his days in his 7-ft. by 12-ft. cell as a form of confinement \"designed to inflict as much misery and pain as constitutionally permissible.\"\n\nBut is it constitutionally permissible? And even if it is, is this the kind of open-ended mental-health experiment the government should be running? \"We have to ask ourselves why we're doing this,\" says psychiatrist Stuart Grassian, a former faculty member at the Harvard Medical School and a consultant in criminal cases. \"These aren't a bunch of cold, controlled James Cagneys. We're taking criminals who are already unstable and driving them crazy.\"\n\nThe origin of solitary confinement in the U.S. is actually benign. It was the Philadelphia Quakers of the 19th century who dreamed up the idea, establishing a program at the city's Walnut Street prison under which inmates were housed in isolation in the hope of providing them with an opportunity for quiet contemplation during which they would develop insight into their crimes.

He wasn\u2019t taking a page from Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s book, but was looking to make a quick buck off the body parts housed in the museum\u2019s collection.\n\nCharles allegedly swiped human brains and other preserved tissue from the museum\u2019s seemingly vast stores of specimens from the 2,000 patients whose remains were autopsied from about the 1890s through the 1940s back when the museum was the Central State Hospital, which served patients with psychiatric and mental disorders from 1848 to 1994. Charles then passed off the maudlin merch to a middleman who sold the specimens on eBay, the online auction site.\n\nPolice had investigated several break-ins at the museum over the last year, but were alerted to the ongoing specimen theft ring when an eBay buyer in San Diego called them. The buyer, who, according to the Indianapolis Star, had bought six jars of human brain tissue off eBay for $600, plus $70 shipping, presumably for completely reasonable purposes, had become suspicious that the brains were stolen when he noticed labels on several of the specimen jars. He called the Indianapolis police who traced the eBay sales to find the seller.\n\nThe seller worked with police to set up a sting operation to catch the wannabe Igor. The eBay middleman set a meeting with Charles in the parking lot of a Dairy Queen, but instead of getting a Frostie and the 60 jars of human tissue Charles had recently stolen from the museum, the police swept in. Charles now faces charges of theft, marijuana possession and paraphernalia possession, according to the Indianapolis Star, with the possibility of additional charges pending and, of course, a Hollywood film offer.\n\nMORE: The Evil Brain: What Lurks Inside a Killer\u2019s Mind\n\nMORE: Cat-DNA Database Helps U.K. Police Solve Crime", "summary": "That's one way to make a living.", "compression": 43.4444444444, "coverage": 0.5555555556, "density": 1.2222222222, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

It was one of the things you assumed you\u2019d never understand. But it\u2019s time for TIME to break down Daylight Saving Time.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s this weekend (Saturday night going into Sunday, to be exact). And since we spring forward and fall back, we\u2019ll all be setting our clocks back Sunday fall morning to get an extra hour of sleep.\n\nDaylight Saving Time dates back to the good ole\u2019 days when we did everything based on when we had sunlight. It got more serious when Benjamin Franklin decided to be \u201cthat guy,\u201d suggesting we all get up earlier to save money on candles. Thanks, Benji. It was a major blow to all the unhappy, unhealthy, and unwise people who love to snooze.\n\nThe practice wasn\u2019t formally implemented until World War I, when countries at war started setting their clocks back to save on coal. Daylight Saving was repealed during peacetime, and then revived again during World War II. More than 70 countries currently practice Daylight Saving Time, because they think it saves money on electricity (in the U.S., Arizona and Hawaii have opted out).\n\nBut studies show that Daylight Saving Time actually results in a one percent overall increase in residential electricity. And that it messes with sleeping patterns. Oh, and also it may cause heart attacks, according to the American Journal of Cardiology. So it\u2019s no surprise that more and more countries are reevaluating whether to hold on to this relic from the past.\n\nBut like all great mysteries, the answers only beget more questions: Does your iPhone automatically update for Daylight Saving Time?", "summary": "TIME explains Daylight Saving Time", "compression": 68.4, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 5.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "paraphrase", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The remote, woody city (literally \u201cjade forest\u201d) celebrates the astronomical event with its annual dog-eating festival. The local tradition reportedly began in the 1990s, but the local practice of eating dog meat outdates written history.\n\nAccording to Chinese lore, eating dog meat stimulates internal heat, making it a food that wards off winters\u2019 cold. But on this inaugural day of summer, it\u2019s a superstition that\u2019s driving dog consumption: the meat is believed to bring good luck and health. At the festival, hotpots are fired up, lychees peeled and liquors poured. Animal activists estimate over 10,000 dogs are killed for the festival, according to China Daily, the government\u2019s English-language mouthpiece.\n\n2. China doesn\u2019t have an animal protection law, but experts still claim the festival is illegal.\n\nA draft law was proposed in 2009 to punish animal abusers with a 6000 yuan (over $900) fine and two weeks of detention. It also proposed that organizations found guilty of selling dog or cat meat be charged with a fine between 10,000 yuan ($1600) and 500,000 yuan ($80,000). To date, the National People\u2019s Congress has not signed the law; it has yet to issue a statement on it.\n\nStill, some legal experts argue the festival is illegal under regulations passed by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2013 which require laboratory quarantine for animals before transportation, a practice that\u2019s \u201crare to see,\u201d animal rights lawyer An Xiang told China Daily. Even more, many dogs are stolen, abducted, raised in households, making dog trade difficult to document (there are also dog farms, too). In 2011, though, Chinese activists stopped a truck transporting dogs to a restaurant and paid 115,000 yuan (then, around $17,000) to free the animals.\n\n3. The festival is also a public health concern.\n\nThe festival is more than an animal rights issue. It is a public health concern. Dogs are often transported in a crowded, brutal and unsanitary atmosphere, sometimes from unknown sources, only to arrive at the festival sick, dying or dead, according to CNN. China\u2019s food safety administration bans selling meat from animals in these conditions. Then there is rabies. Prolonged exposure to unvaccinated dogs increases the chance of contracting the deadly disease. And studies have found, according to CNN, that Yulin\u2019s incidence of human rabies cases is among the top ten of Chinese cities.\n\n4. Outrage on social media over the 2014 festival was unprecedented.\n\nFor years, hundreds of thousands of Chinese netizens have been vocal in opposing dog-eating festivals. Though keeping dogs as pets was banned during the Cultural Revolution, dog ownership has become popular among China\u2019s growing middle-class.\n\nIn addition to a petition, puppy rescues and editorials, many celebrities joined in protesting Yulin\u2019s festival on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. Actress Sun Li uploaded photos of her son with their adopted stray dog, and singer-actress Yang Mi posted a plea to end dog eating with an anti-Yulin festival poster that\u2019s flooding Chinese social media. In the poster, a dog sheds a red tear, saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t eat us. We\u2019re your friends.\u201d\n\n5. The 2014 festival may have begun early to avoid protestors.\n\nYulin locals have reportedly kicked-off the celebrations a week early to avoid activists and journalists, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Street vendors and restaurants selling dog meat have covered up the Chinese character for dog, too, in an effort to mitigate controversy.\n\n6. Dog-eating festivals have been banned in the past, but Yulin officials claim the festival does not exist.\n\nIn 2011, Chinese authorities banned the Jinhua Hutou Dog Meat Festival after a widespread social media campaign launched by animal rights activists. The 600-year tradition, held annually in September, commemorated a fourteenth-century battle victory when a rebel leader ordered dogs in Jinhua to be slaughtered because their barking warned the city of his army\u2019s approach.\n\nIn contrast, the Yulin Municipal People\u2019s Government issued a statement on June 7 in response to the social media outrage, stating that while locals in recent years have hosted small gatherings to consume dog meat and lychees, a widespread festival for these activities has never existed.\n\n\u201cThe so-called summer solstice lychee dog meat festival does not exist,\u201d it reads. \u201cNeither Yulin government nor social organizations have ever held such activities.\u201d", "summary": "The annual festival sparks unprecedented backlash", "compression": 148.3333333333, "coverage": 0.6666666667, "density": 0.6666666667, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML+WL", "comment": "Little new information.", "marked_as_extractive": false}

But these seasonal changes aren\u2019t welcomed by everyone. For many of us, they\u2019re eclipsed by the itchy eyes, sneezing, and congestion of hay fever and other allergies. What to do?\n\nSome allergies are severe and require the attention of a doctor or other health care professional. For milder cases, though, home remedies may provide all the relief you need, with relatively little expense or hassle. Even people with bad allergies who need medication may find these at-home tips helpful for easing symptoms.\n\nThey may look exotic, but Neti pots are fast becoming a mainstream remedy for allergies and stuffed-up sinuses. The treatment, which involves rinsing your nasal cavity with a saline solution, flushes out allergens (like pollen) and loosens mucus.\n\nUsing a Neti pot is simple. First, fill the pot with a mixture of salt and warm water (you can buy pre-measured kits or make your own). Then tilt your head to the side and pour the solution in one nostril until it flows out the other, repeating the process on the opposite side. (Important note: Use boiled or distilled water only, as tap water can introduce potentially dangerous organisms into your system.)\n\nPrepackaged saline nasal sprays function much like Neti pots, but some allergy sufferers may find them easier to use. Sprays deliver saline solution a bit more gently and evenly, whereas pots can sometimes be a little \u201csloppy,\u201d says Robert Graham, MD, an internist and integrative medicine specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.\n\nSaline sprays should provide comparable results. Although Neti pots have been studied more extensively, and in some cases may prove more effective, sprays too have been shown to help with allergy symptoms and other sinus problems.\n\nRead more: 14 Reasons You\u2019re Always Tired\n\nEating honey produced by bees in your region can help relieve allergies. The bees transfer pollen from flower blossoms to honey, so if you eat a little honey every day you\u2019ll gradually become inoculated against the irritating effects of pollen.\n\nThat\u2019s the widely held theory, anyway. Unfortunately, there\u2019s little to no scientific evidence to back it up. Although a small 2011 study from Finland that compared regular honey and pollen-laced honey did report modestly encouraging results, an earlier study in the United States found that unaltered local honey had no impact on allergy symptoms.\n\nHigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters ease symptoms by trapping allergens and other airborne irritants, such as pet dander and dust. Portable air cleaners equipped with HEPA filters can purify the air in bedrooms and other confined spaces, but whole-house systems that incorporate HEPA filters into your home\u2019s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system are generally more effective.\n\nAir conditioners and dehumidifiers also can help clean air, Dr. Graham says. They remove moisture from the air and floor, which will curb the growth of the mold and mildew that can worsen allergies.\n\nRead more: 10 Ways to Soothe a Sore Throat\n\nSeveral herbs and supplements\u2014including spirulina, eyebright, and goldenseal\u2014have been studied for allergy relief. The plant extract butterbur, which is thought to reduce airway inflammation, has produced what are perhaps the strongest results. In a pair of clinical trials led by a Swiss research team, butterbur tablets eased symptoms just as much as the over-the-counter antihistamines fexofenadine and cetirizine, respectively.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Graham suggests his patients first try bromelain, an enzyme found in pineapple that is sometimes used to curb inflammation after sinus surgery. \u201cIt reduces swelling and improves breathing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe first step.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has even been stuffed-up knows the impressive ability of a steaming hot shower to soothe sinuses and clear nasal passages, if only temporarily. But showers offer an added benefit for springtime allergy sufferers. A quick rinse after spending time outdoors can help remove allergens from your skin and hair\u2014and prevent them from spreading to clothes, furniture, pillowcases, and other surfaces where they\u2019re likely to dog you.\n\nThis is especially true if you\u2019ve been gardening. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology recommends stripping off your shoes and clothes and showering immediately if you\u2019ve been weeding, pruning, or planting.\n\nRead more: 15 Diseases Doctors Often Get Wrong\n\nDon\u2019t feel like getting soaked and toweling off every time your sinuses get clogged? Other methods of inhaling steam\u2014store-bought vaporizers, for instance\u2014can flush out mucus and moisten dry nasal passages nearly as well as a shower.\n\nThe easiest method is simply to pour boiling water into a bowl or other container, drape a towel over your head to form a tent, and inhale deeply through your nose for five to 10 minutes. (Just be careful not to get your face too close to the water, as you may scald yourself.) If you find yourself really clogged up, this may be more convenient than taking several showers a day.\n\nThe strong, piney aroma of eucalyptus oil can supercharge steam inhalation, helping to open your sinuses and nasal passages further. Some research suggests the essential oil, extracted from the leaves of the eucalyptus tree, has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, but if nothing else the vapor provides a bracing, menthol-like sensation that can make breathing seem easier.\n\nTry adding a few drops of oil to a bowl of steaming water, or to the floor of the shower before you step in. Just don\u2019t swallow the oil or apply it directly to your skin; it\u2019s toxic in concentrated amounts.\n\nMany people swear by the sinus-clearing effects of spicy foods like chili peppers, wasabi, Dijon mustard, fresh garlic, and horseradish. Sure enough, an active ingredient in garlic (allyl thiosulfinate) and a similar ingredient in wasabi (isothiocyanates) do appear to have a temporary decongestant effect.\n\nFoods with a kick can definitely start your eyes watering and open your nasal passages, but it\u2019s unclear whether they provide anything more than fleeting relief.\n\nRead more: 11 Unexpected Spring Allergy Triggers\n\nHolding your face over a hot cup of tea may open your nasal passages, but the steam isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s beneficial.

Two of the victims were shot in the head, in what Interior Minister Manuel Valls said was \u201cno doubt an execution\u201d. One of them was Sakine Cansiz, co-founder of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a group that has waged an often violent Kurdish separatist struggle against Turkey, and which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nThe slayings come at a sensitive time. Turkish media reports the Ankara government has recently made progress towards ending the nearly three decades of violence through unpublicized peace talks with some PKK leaders, included jailed PKK chief Abdullah Ocalan. Such peace talks are not supported by all PKK militants \u2014 a strategic division that may have caused a schism within the group.\n\n(MORE: How the Kurds Have Changed Turkey\u2019s Calculations on Syria)\n\ntop Turkish politicians speculating that the Paris murders were a result of \u201can internal feud\u201d within the PKK. But that claim was rejected by many of the hundreds of Kurds who gathered Thursday morning outside the Kurdish Information Center in Paris where the\n\n; instead, they blamed Ankara.\n\n\u201cThe murder of these three Kurdish women, at this time, is a political crime,\u201d Berivan Akyol, a worker at the center, told French news channel i-t\u00e9l\u00e9. \u201cThese three victims\u2026 represent all Kurds.\u201d\n\nThe deceased had apparently been shot Wednesday afternoon, and were discovered at around 1 a.m. Thursday after concerned colleagues failed to reach them by phone. In addition to PKK co-founder Cansiz, a woman described as a representative of the Brussels-based Kurdistan National Congress was among the dead. According to the Firat news agency \u2014 which is considered sympathetic to the Kurdish cause \u2014 two of the women were shot in the head and a third in the stomach by a silencer-fitted gun.\n\nFrench security officials tell TIME it\u2019s still too early to openly speculate about who was behind the killings \u2014 though two obvious theories are already under consideration. Given the brutality with which Turkey has at times sought to suppress Kurdish nationalism and the violent methods sometimes used by the PKK its struggle for autonomy, French authorities believe that both scenarios \u2014 an assassination ordered by the PKK\u2019s enemies, or a deadly factional split \u2014 are equally plausible.\n\n(MORE: French Draft Law On Armenian Genocide Rocks Franco-Turkish Relations)\n\nThe first thesis, said a French security official who did not want to be quoted, might aim at weakening PKK factions hostile to negotiating an end to the conflict. The second second, he added, might seek to further widen the split between rival PKK camps over peace talks, and thereby hamper further efforts in striking a deal with Turkey. But whatever the motive for the killing, Valls pledged to bring to justice those responsible.\n\n\u201cThe anti-terrorism and (homicide) units have been mobilized to shed light on this absolutely intolerable act,\u201d Valls said Thursday morning outside the Kurdish center, not far from Paris\u2019 Gare du Nord train station. \u201cI have come to express my compassion for those who are close to these three women.\u201d\n\nValls was also addressing the hundreds of sorrowful and angry Kurds who\u2019d flocked to the center early Thursday, chanting Ocalan\u2019s name and \u201cWe Are All PKK.\u201d Around 150,000 Kurds live in France, many as political exiles. Meanwhile, despite the PKK\u2019s terrorist designation, the organization has enjoyed the ambivalent support of many in Europe sympathetic to the Kurdish plight.\n\nThat ambivalence has at times also been reflected by French justice officials. While authorities have repeatedly arrested militants suspected of organizing or financing acts of PKK terror, less troublesome party members and sympathizers are generally left alone. The 28-year battle between the PKK and Turkey has claimed around 40,000 lives, with violence at times having spilled into other countries. The chants of \u201cA Political Solution for Kurdistan\u201d among Kurdish mourners in Paris Thursday appeared to express hopes that this new trio of deaths in that struggle will be the last.\n\n(MORE: A Turkish War of Religion: Kurdish Activists Sense a Conspiracy)", "summary": "Three Kurdish nationalists found murdered in Paris amid reports of peace talks between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers' Party spark clashing theories over who was responsible for the killings", "compression": 28.1666666667, "coverage": 0.7333333333, "density": 1.1333333333, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The environmental impact still is being assessed, but so far there is no evidence of widespread harm to birds and sea life.\n\nThe early toll on wildlife included two oil-covered pelicans, officials said. Biologists counted dead fish and crustaceans along sandy beaches and rocky shores.\n\nThe spill occurred along a long, rustic coast that forms the northern boundary of the Santa Barbara Channel, home to a rich array of sea life. Whales, dolphins, sea lions, seals, sea otters and birds such as pelicans live along the channel between the mainland and the Channel Islands, five of which are a national park surrounded by waters declared a national marine sanctuary.\n\nWorkers in protective suits have shoveled black sludge off beaches, and boats towed booms into place to corral two oil slicks. The cleanup effort continued through the night and additional crew members and boats came out early Thursday, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Jonathan McCormick said.\n\nThey could get help from expected light winds and calm seas, said Dr. Sean Anderson, an environmental scientist at California State University, Channel Islands.\n\n\u201cWhen the water\u2019s choppy, the response gets complicated.

Company officials didn\u2019t say how long it leaked before it was discovered and shut down or discuss how fast the oil escaped.\n\nFederal regulators from the Department of Transportation, which oversees oil pipeline safety, investigated the leak\u2019s cause, the pipe\u2019s condition and the potential violations.\n\nThe 24-inch pipe built in 1991 had no previous problems and was thoroughly inspected in 2012, according to the company. The pipe underwent similar tests about two weeks ago, though the results had not been analyzed yet.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the company accumulated 175 safety and maintenance infractions since 2006, according to federal records. The infractions involved pump failure, equipment malfunction, pipeline corrosion and operator error. The newspaper said a Plains Pipeline spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its regulatory record.\n\nThere was no estimate on the cost of the cleanup or how long it might take.\n\nA combination of soiled beaches and the pungent stench of petroleum led officials to close popular campgrounds Refugio State Beach and El Capitan State Beach over the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nStill, tourists pulled off the Pacific Coast Highway to eye the disaster from overlooking bluffs.\n\n\u201cIt smells like what they use to pave the roads,\u201d said Fan Yang, of Indianapolis, who was hoping to find cleaner beaches in Santa Barbara, about 20 miles away. \u201cI\u2019m sad for the birds \u2014 if they lose their habitat.\u201d\n\nThe state Department of Fish and Wildlife closed fishing and shellfish harvesting for a mile east and west of Refugio beach and deployed booms to protect the nesting and foraging habitat of the snowy plover and the least tern, both endangered shore birds.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday night declared a state of emergency, a move that frees up additional state funding to help with the cleanup.\n\nThe coastline was the scene of a much larger spill in 1969 \u2014 the largest in U.S. waters at the time \u2014 that is credited with giving rise to the American environmental movement.\n\nEnvironmental groups used the spill as a new opportunity to take a shot at fossil fuels and remind people of the area\u2019s notoriety with oil spills.\n\n\u201cBig Oil comes with big risks \u2014 from drilling to delivery,\u201d said Bob Deans, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cSanta Barbara learned that lesson over 40 years ago when offshore drilling led to disaster.\u201d\n\nLarge offshore rigs still dot the horizon off the coast, pumping crude to shore and small amounts of tar from natural seepage regularly show up on beaches.", "summary": "Up to 105,000 gallons may have leaked from a ruptured pipeline", "compression": 84.3636363636, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 6.2727272727, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "comment": "", "marked_as_extractive": true}

The U.K, which includes England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, is divided into 650 constituencies. Each elects a single MP to represent the constituency in the House of Commons in the Palace of Westminster in London.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit like the U.S presidential elections and House of Representative elections rolled into one. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWho stands in the elections? Independent candidates can stand in elections, but most candidates are members of political parties. The first five parties have candidates in most of the U.K. while the next four only field candidates in the area specified within brackets.\n\nHow is the Prime Minister elected? The Prime Minister is not directly elected. He or she is the leader of the party that can command the confidence of the largest number of MPs.\n\nWho are the main party leaders? David Cameron, the current Prime Minister, is the leader of the Conservatives. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, is the leader of the Liberal Democrats. Ed Miliband is the leader of the Labour Party. Nicola Sturgeon leads the SNP and Nigel Farage is the leader of UKIP.\n\nRead More on Sturgeon and Farage here: This Woman Is Forecast to be the Biggest Winner of the U.K. Election Meet the Most Controversial Man in the U.K. Election\n\nHow do the parties relate to parties in the U.S? It is difficult to make direct comparisons, but the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats are closest to the Democrats and most Conservatives and all of UKIP would find themselves among the Republicans. However some Conservatives would also feel at home with the Democrats. In general, the center ground in the U.S. is more right wing than in the U.K. Most of the other parties represent regional interests.\n\nHow do the elections affect the U.S.? The results of the elections would probably only concern the White House, the State Department and the Department of Defense. The SNP wants Scotland to secede from the U.K., which could weaken it as a strategic ally of the U.S. The SNP also wants to scrap the U.K.\u2019s Trident ballistic-nuclear-missile program, which could reduce the U.K.\u2019s military power. UKIP wants the U.K. to leave the European Union, which would be against the desires of the U.S.\n\nWho is going to win? The latest opinion poll suggests there will be a hung Parliament in which no single party has a majority of the 650 seats and there is no clear winner.\n\nThis was the prediction on May 5.\n\nThe numbers refer to seats in the House of Commons. To get a majority, a party needs a minimum of 326 seats.\n\nWhat happens in the event of a hung Parliament? The leader of the largest party or the leader of the party who can command the confidence of the most MPs will be asked by the Queen to form a coalition government. This involves the parties trying to agree on a platform on which they can form a government that can command a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nIn the meantime, the sitting Prime Minister will continue to run the government.\n\nHow long will it take to form a coalition government? In 2010, it took five days, but the new Prime Minister would have to be close to a deal by May 18 when the new House of Commons meets and certainly by May 27 when the Queen is scheduled to read out the program of the new government.\n\nWhat if the leader cannot form a government? The Queen will ask the leader of the next party to try to form a government or call for fresh elections.\n\nRead more: This New Yorker Is Already Mayor of London but Is he the Future Leader of the U.K.?", "summary": "On Thursday, the U.K. will elect a new government in one of the tightest polls for more than a century", "compression": 34.9523809524, "coverage": 0.8095238095, "density": 1.0952380952, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

This is a campaign book, written by a candidate (via her speechwriters), processed through a political machine, and delivered to the public with the contradictory goals of depicting the author as a decisive leader and not betraying any evidence of leadership that would turn a voter off. Here is how the candidate-without-an-official-campaign describes the choice facing the country in the next presidential election:\n\nUltimately, what happens in 2016 should be about what kind of future Americans want for themselves and their children\u2014and grandchildren. I hope we choose inclusive politics and a common purpose to unleash the creativity, potential, and opportunity that makes America exceptional. That\u2019s what all American people deserve.\n\nReal people who aren\u2019t running for office do not write like this. They do not think like this. They do not try to string together feel-good words in decisive ways that pretend at taking bold stands on the future without actually taking any stand. There are no clear-thinking Americans who do not want \u201cinclusive politics\u201d or \u201ccommon purpose.\u201d There is no one in public or private life in this country who does not want to \u201cunleash the creativity, potential and opportunity\u201d of the nation. So why write it? Because it is campaign mumbo-jumbo, and campaign mumbo-jumbo works if you want to win elections.\n\nClinton is only able to say that she not yet decided about running for President because of a legal technicality: She has not yet declared that she is running for President. But in the current environment, and with this book, that should not matter. She is doing exactly what she would do if she knew she was going to declare. It\u2019s as if she left her home, walked down the street to her local bar, took a seat on a stool, handed the barkeep her credit card, and then told him, \u201cI haven\u2019t decided whether or not to order a drink.\u201d She still has time to choose not to order the drink. She may not be a candidate when the Iowa caucuses meet. But that shouldn\u2019t prevent anyone from observing what she is doing in the meantime.\n\nAnd what she is doing in this book is a thing to behold. Over nearly 600 pages, she gives a grand tour of American foreign policy as seen from the communications operation of the U.S. State Department. There are dozens of pages devoted to singing the praises\u2014and naming the names\u2014of the people she worked with and the things she accomplished. There are hundreds of pages of history, recounting the major events of the last five years in a useful, matter-of-fact voice that would be well-suited to a high school textbook. There are some wonderful admissions and asides, like her habit of digging her fingernails into her hand when she gets sleepy at meetings, or the time when former French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared, while watching a traffic jam of motorcades after a frustrating day of summits in Copenhagen, \u201cI want to die!\u201d\n\nThere are also carefully constructed personal recollections of some of the hard choices she made, like her support for the Osama bin Laden raid, with which President Barack Obama agreed, and her support for arming the Syrian rebels, with which Obama disagreed. But as often as not, the hard choices are so polished as to lose their edge. She admits to a shouting match with the former CIA director over whether or not to authorize a particular drone strike, but on the subject of her approach to drone strikes in general she offers only diplo-babble fortune cookies. She agrees with Obama that the strikes raised \u201cprofound questions,\u201d and writes that it\u2019s \u201ccrucial that these strikes be part of a larger smart power counterterrorism strategy that included diplomacy, law enforcement, sanctions, and other tools.\u201d Got it?\n\nThere are other hard choices she clearly runs away from making. After mentioning the controversy over the National Security Agency\u2019s mass collection of domestic phone records without a warrant, she offers a puzzle instead of a position: \u201cWithout security, liberty is fragile,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout liberty, security is oppressive. The challenge is finding the proper measure: enough security to safeguard our freedoms, but not so much (or so little) as to endanger them.\u201d Even the NSA will struggle to decode that one.\n\nShe devotes an entire chapter to the need to take on climate change, imploring policy makers to save the world in the most vacuous language of policy making, which keeps rearing its head throughout the book: \u201cBuilding a broad national consensus on the urgency of the climate threat and the imperative of a bold and comprehensive response will not be easy, but it is essential.\u201d But she makes no mention of her position on the Keystone pipeline, which is arguably the most central domestic climate change issue she faced, and which coincidentally divides the Democratic Party.\n\nPerhaps there is no reason to expect more from a politician in mid-stride. Barack Obama\u2019s first book, Dreams of My Father, was widely hailed as a deeply personal literary work in its own right. The book he wrote before his 2008 campaign, The Audacity of Hope, was a far inferior list of policy maxims, Republican bashing and feel-good utopianism. But assuming she continues her campaign, Clinton has a problem to solve that Obama never had before he ran: She must convince voters both within and without the Democratic Party that she is a real person people can believe in, not just a political brand that is repolished and reintroduced to the public at regular intervals under the soft lights of a primetime television interview.\n\nIn Hard Choices, Clinton limits her personal admissions to the expected: Praise and pride in her daughter Chelsea, a tribute to her mother Dorothy, who passed in late 2011, and some glimpses of the personal toll of traveling 2,000 hours by plane to 122 countries over four years. Then, in the final pages, there is the hint of more:\n\nRecently, Bill and I took another of our long walks, this time with our three dogs, near our home. It had been an unseasonably long winter, but spring was finally peeking through the thaw. We walked and talked, continuing a conversation that began more than forty years ago at Yale Law School and hasn\u2019t stopped yet.\n\nDo you want to know what happened next? What they talked about? How things have changed for the most storied political couple in the land? Well, you won\u2019t find it here. The paragraph over, she changes the topic, and moves on, with no indication why the walk might have been important or interesting, or needed to be included in her book.\n\nClinton has made the hard choice to hide any details of the hardest choice to come in a book she calls Hard Choices.

Their web site invites visitors to \"Liberate yourself from the Original Mumbo-Jumbo that liberated you from the Original Sin you never had\" and allows them to print out a paper certificate that uses quasi-formal language to \"reject baptism's creeds and other such superstitions.\" But in recent months, as tens of thousands began to download the certificate, organizers realized that they had struck a chord with atheists and once-devout church members who are leaving churches they see as increasingly out-of-tune with modern life. \"Churches have become so reactionary, so politically active that people actually want to make a protest against them now,\" Sanderson says. \"They're not just indifferent anymore. They're actively hostile.\" (See pictures at a drive-in church.)\n\nThe campaign has become so popular \u0097 with nearly 1,000 certificates downloaded each week \u0097 that the NSS has started taking orders for certificates printed on parchment, at $4.50 each; they've sold nearly 2,000 in just three weeks. \"Every time the Pope says something outrageous we get another rush on the certificate,\" Sanderson says, noting that traffic to the site skyrocketed last month following Pope Benedict XVI's comment that condoms could worsen the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n\nPublic gaffes like that one may explain the anti-Catholic backlash driving similar movements elsewhere in the world. In October last year, Italy's Union of Rationalist Atheist and Agnostics sponsored the country's first-ever \"De-baptism Day,\" when the no-longer faithful attended protests and passed out de-baptism forms to areligious people who didn't have internet connections to download them. More recently, on March 2, atheists and feminists in Argentina teamed up to launch the \"Not in my Name\" Internet campaign which encourages Roman Catholics to notify their local bishops of their desire to officially leave the church. So far more than 1,800 have joined their Facebook group or signed the petition on their website http://www.apostasiacolectiva.org.\n\nAccording to Argentine campaigner Ariel Bellino, a former Catholic: \"The church counts all those who've been baptized as Catholic and lobbies for legislation based on that number, so we're trying to convey the importance of people expressing they no longer belong to the church.\" Campaigners say that's particularly important in Argentina, where liberal social values frequently clash with Roman Catholic doctrine related to issues such as birth control, abstinence before marriage and homosexuality; in 2003, Buenos Aries became the first city in South America to legalize gay civil unions.\n\nBack in Britain, Michael Evans, an atheist and former journalist who downloaded the de-baptism certificate in March, believes the Church of England claims more members than it actually has in order to shore up its influence in the secular world. \"It claims to speak for the majority of people in Britain,\" he says. Official estimates are that fewer than one million Britons regularly attend Sunday services, but there are currently 26 Church of England bishops sitting in the House of Lords. \"With churches, everybody checks in, but nobody checks out,\" says Evans, who was baptized as an infant. \"There's no exit strategy except the funeral.\"\n\nThat may be changing. On April 9, John Hunt, a 56-year-old nurse in Croydon, south London, managed to have his official baptism record amended. Religious leaders from the Southwark Diocese had previously refused to delete Hunt's record of baptism, claiming it was an important historical detail. But after Hunt published a renouncement of his Christianity in the London Gazette, a journal of record dating back to the 17th century, those same religious leaders agreed to include it alongside his official baptism entry. \"It's about time some of us stood up to be counted,\" Hunt said after receiving the news.\n\nNick Baines, the Bishop of Croydon, says such notation makes little difference. \"Sticking John Hunt's note in the register is not 'de-anything,'\" he wrote on his blog. \"It is simply a note in a register that has no effect whatsoever other than to make him feel better that he has been heard.\" And, officials at the Church of England say, allowing such notation is not the Church's official policy because true renunciation can only take place between an individual and God.\n\nGiven that God takes on different forms for different people, the NSS has been approached by non-believers are far away as Australia, Romania and Saudi Arabia requesting certificates tailored to their former faith. \"We've had Jewish people write in asking, 'Can I have a certificate to undo my bar mitzvah?'\" says Sanderson. And while the group is considering those requests, there's at least one recurring query they're certain they can't undo, symbolically or otherwise: \"How can I get myself uncircumcised?\"\n\nSee pictures of Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nSee TIME's Pictures of the Week.", "summary": "A British secular society claims that thousands of former Christians have chosen to publicly renounce their faith with certificates of de-baptism", "compression": 44.652173913, "coverage": 0.9130434783, "density": 2.3913043478, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Take America\u2019s most recent shale oil boom, and bust, for example. On the way up, you may have seen \u2013 Why OPEC Could Be Dead in 10 Years. Conversely, now you may have read, Why It Might Be \u2018Game Over For The Fracking Boom\u2019.\n\nIn the end, the answer lies somewhere in-between. OPEC, although often plagued with internal discord, will still remain the global defacto 900-pound gorilla of crude, and US producers will continue to find ways to crack shale rock cheaper and more efficiently, immunizing themselves to nail-biting commodity roller coaster dips like what was just experienced. And in 2008 (-55%). And in 2001 (-32%). And in 1998 (-38%)\u2026.\n\nBP, in its recently-released \u201cEnergy Outlook 2035\u201d, predicts OPEC\u2019s market share will return to approximately 40 percent of global demand within 15 years, up from 33 percent today, which is what all this fuss is about anyway.\n\nRead more: No Real Oil Price Relief Until Q3\n\nHere are 3 reasons why America\u2019s shale will continue to produce going forward:\n\n1. Oil companies, both large and small, have seen what is possible.\n\nIn 2004, Texas oilman George Mitchell made hydraulic fracture stimulation commercially viable by unlocking the right combination of water pressure and lubricants to allow oil and gas to predictably flow from dense shale to the wellbore. A decade ago, producers believed shale held vast oil and gas resources, but to what extent they could be developed had not been determined. Until now.\n\nLast year for example, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) announced there could be up to 75 billion additional barrels of oil in the Permian Basin, a field believed to be mostly dried up. The EIA also forecast over 100 years of natural gas supply from shale resources, mostly flowing from the vast Marcellus and Utica formations in the Northeast.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons America\u2019s shale revolution will continue is producers have seen the potential. As with any industry, technology should drive cost down, and drillers and producers are both mutually highly incentivized to find cheaper, faster, better ways of extraction.\n\n2. Eventually, politicians might \u201cGet It\u201d.\n\nThe shale oil revolution that peaked in 2014 occurred mostly in spite of Washington, D.C., not because of it. With Capitol Hill and the White House mired in political gridlock for most of the last 6 years, oil and gas producers were thus free to explore, develop, and prove the concept that shale development was indeed commercially viable.\n\nRead more: Could Oil Prices Plummet A Second Time?\n\nIn a perfect scenario, the next phase would involve political leadership who comprehends the benefit of an alliance between Canada, Mexico and the United States, creating a formidable energy superpower, ultimately likely leading to North American energy independence from any imported oil.\n\n3. In spite of the current dip, global demand points up\n\nBP and ExxonMobil, in their long-range forecasts, both allude to the same conclusion \u2013 the macro trend for oil consumption worldwide is up. BP predicts a 41 percent increase in demand over the next 20 years, with China and India accounting for half the growth.\n\nExxonMobil concurs. Basing their forecast on a continued population explosion to 9 billion people by 2040, Exxon theorizes GDP will grow parabolically, and in spite of energy efficiencies that will certainly be realized along the way, demand for all forms of energy will continue to increase. In their Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040, Exxon confirms the \u201call of the above\u201d theory to meet global demand.\n\nThomas Hood, English poet, author and humorist was quoted to say, \u201cExtremes meet, as the whiting said, with its tail in its mouth.\u201d Oil producers have work to do. They must reduce costs, continue to solve environmental concerns over extraction techniques, and scale efficiencies. This bust has offered plenty of incentive to accelerate that. But there is still an abundance of oil and gas to be extracted, with ample incentive to figure out the most efficient ways to develop it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Oilprice.com.", "summary": "Despite the current dip, global demand points up", "compression": 93.8888888889, "coverage": 0.8888888889, "density": 7.1111111111, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "comment": "Bad summary.

Will other sites join in? Should we prepare for the Great Internet Strike of 2012?\n\nWriting that it\u2019s \u201cnot taking this action lightly,\u201d Reddit announced on Tuesday that it will black out its site on Jan. 18 for 12 hours, starting at 8 a.m. E.T. During that period, the site\u2019s content will be replaced with \u201ca simple message about how the PIPA/SOPA legislation would shut down sites like reddit, link to resources to learn more, and suggest ways to take action.\u201d The company will also run a live video stream of that day\u2019s House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on Internet security, intellectual property and economic growth.\n\n(MORE: The Coolest Smartphones of CES 2012)\n\nOn the site\u2019s blog, the Reddit team admitted that \u201cwe\u2019re as addicted to reddit as the rest of you,\u201d but also explained that \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t do this if we didn\u2019t believe this legislation and the forces behind it were a serious threat to reddit and the Internet as we know it. Blacking out reddit is a hard choice, but we feel focusing on a day of action is the best way we can amplify the voice of the community.\u201d The company says support for a blackout isn\u2019t unanimous among the Reddit community, and it is asking for input as it decides what to do next.\n\nWithout unanimous support among Reddit\u2019s community, it will be interesting to see how things go for Wikipedia if that site follows suit. Wales writes, \u201cIt would be great if we could act quickly to coordinate with Reddit,\u201d though he adds that the community needs a \u201cthumbs up/thumbs down vote\u201d on whether to participate, and \u201cwe don\u2019t have the luxury of time that we usually have, in terms of negotiating with each other for weeks about what\u2019s exactly the best possible thing to do.\u201d I suspect the ratio of those in favor of a blackout to those opposed would be greater for a more activist site like Reddit than one that\u2019s more mainstream (and let\u2019s be honest, passive) like Wikipedia.\n\n(MORE: 12 Unique Ultrabooks and Tablets You Should Know About)\n\nI appreciate that Reddit\u2019s announcement factored in the importance of educating would-be visitors to the site about why it decided to go dark, what SOPA is and why it\u2019s so important. I can only assume Wikipedia would do the same, should the community decide to go dark on the same day. After all, protests work only when people understand why they\u2019re happening.\n\nThat said, now that we have a date for a potential shutdown, the question becomes, Who else will join in? Google, Twitter and Facebook have all been rumored as contenders, in part because of comments made by NetCoalition\u2019s Markham Erickson. (When I asked, Google and Twitter declined to comment on their support for an Internet blackout.) But with a strike looming and despite attempts to push the issue onto agendas, support for this kind of action may be shifting in favor of alternative methods. Finding other ways to protest may be ineluctable \u2014 after all, we\u2019re talking about the Internet\u2019s most popular sites going dark for 24 hours.\n\nSure, there may be some disappointment that we\u2019re not days from Temporary Internet Apocalypse to Prove a Point, but I suspect there\u2019s relief as well. The idea of a multipronged attack on pro-SOPA arguments \u2014 including different flavors of activism and discussion \u2014 seems like the more mature response on the part of tech companies (which, after all, may not agree on what\u2019s wrong with SOPA as it stands). Let Wikipedia close for the day and generate headlines, while others like Google and Facebook pursue alternative forms of protest that engage their respective audiences. In the end, the more people paying attention, the better.\n\n(MORE: Check out Techland\u2019s coverage of the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show)\n\nGraeme McMillan is a reporter at TIME.

Well now, that\u2019s a question for George Washington, who espoused a great many words that would put today\u2019s Americans in a tizzy.\n\nIn honor of Independence Day, NewsFeed has put together a list of tantalizing terms that our Founding Fathers pronounced on their patriotic tongues. Some are slang, some are now obsolete and some are simply wonderful words that aren\u2019t used enough these days. For many items, we\u2019ve included quotations straight from the Fathers themselves, all taken from citations in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nIn the name of historical appreciation, Americans might resolve to use at least one of these tomorrow. Goodness knows plenty of Yankees will be heading to the tippling house:\n\nalphabeted (adj.): arranged in alphabetical order. This is a prime example of a \u201cverbed\u201d noun that is more economical than spelling the whole thing out. Washington didn\u2019t arrange ledgers in alphabetical order in 1771; he alphabeted them.\n\nblackguardism (n.): abusive or scurrilous language; swearing. Blackguard was shorthand for a villainous attendant or follower, so by extension bad language got this name. \u201cThe public,\u201d Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1799, \u201cwish to hear reason instead of disgusting blackguardism.\u201d\n\nBloody Bones (n): a bogeyman or bugbear, especially invoked to frighten children. In some tales, Bloody Bones skulks in ponds, waiting to drown kiddies; he was often mentioned along with \u201cRaw Head,\u201d a scary skull-faced thing. TJ used the metaphor to talk about fellow politicos: \u201cHancock and the Adamses were the raw-head and bloody bones of Tories and traitors,\u201d he wrote in 1817.\n\ncrapulous (adj.): characterized by gross excess in drinking or eating; intemperate, debauched. In the year that the U.S. Constitution came to be, Jefferson took time to write about other men\u2019s \u201ccrapulous habits.\u201d (We might reprise this today as a word meaning approximately \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good.\u201d)\n\nfrowzy (adj.): ill-smelling, fusty, musty; having an unpleasant smell from being dirty, unwashed, ill-ventilated or the like. In all his various pursuits, Benjamin Franklin was bound to come across some frowzy \u2014 also frouzy \u2014 things. \u201cIt is the frouzy, corrupt air from animal substances,\u201d he declared in 1773.\n\ngimcrack (n.): a person who has an aptitude for mechanical things; a jack-of-all-trades. \u201cThere is also a gimcrack corkscrew,\u201d Franklin wrote in 1766, \u201cwhich you must get some brother gimcrack to show you the use of.\u201d Everyone take a moment to consider who among your friends you can start calling \u201cBrother Gimcrack\u201d (pronounced Jim-krak). And keep in mind that the word has other meanings.\n\nhatchet man (n.): a pioneer or axeman serving in a military unit. Back in Washington\u2019s day, a hatchet man was exactly what it sounded like. Later, the term was used in the U.S. to refer to hired Chinese assassins. And today a hatchet man is typically a person employed to attack and destroy other people\u2019s reputations.\n\nhuskanoy (v.): to subject someone to the ceremony, formerly in use among the Indians of Virginia, of preparing young men for the duties of manhood by means of solitary confinement and the use of narcotics. The real question, of course, is how such a thing ever fell out of practice. In 1788, Jefferson wrote that a man was \u201cso much out of his element that he has the air of one huskanoyed.\u201d\n\nhuzzy (n.): a disreputable woman of improper behavior; a badly behaved, pert or mischievous girl; a minx. Today one might hear the variation hussy, but foresightful Washington knew that words are way cooler when you put z\u2019s in them. \u201cA more \u2026 impudent huzzy, is not to be found in the United States,\u201d he wrote in 1795.\n\nmickle (n.): a large sum or amount, chiefly used in the proverbs \u201cmany a pickle makes a mickle\u201d and \u201cmany a mickle makes a muckle.\u201d In 1793, Washington referenced the Scottish adage that \u201cNothing in nature is more true \u2026 [than] many mickles make a muckle.\u201d Predecessors of mickle include the Old Saxon mikil and Middle High German michel.\n\nmilk-and-water (adj.): something feeble, insipid or mawkish. \u201cI had heard him say that this constitution was a shilly shally thing of mere milk and water, which could not last,\u201d Jefferson wrote in 1792. Shilly-shally means irresolute and undecided. Tomorrow, Americans will celebrate \u201chim\u201d being wrong on both accounts.\n\npartie carr\u00e9e (n.): a party of four people, especially one comprising two men and two women. This term comes from French that roughly means \u201csquare party.\u201d TJ described going out in partie carr\u00e9es. (One couldn\u2019t expect him to spend all that time in France without picking up an affectation or deux.)\n\nred-heeled (adj.): wearing shoes with red heels, figuratively used to suggest foppishness or ostentatious display. In 1780, Franklin derided a \u201cred-heeled\u201d commissioner, who was presumably not wearing Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nSeptemberize (v.): to murder for political reasons. \u201cThe warhawks talk of Septembrizing,\u201d Jefferson wrote in 1798. The word comes from the French \u201cSeptemberists\u201d who advocated the massacre of political prisoners that took place in Paris in September 1792.\n\ntippling house (n.): a house where intoxicating liquor is sold and drunk; an ale house, a tavern. As far back as 1757, Washington was relating stories about \u201cInstances of the villainous Behavior of those Tippling-House-keepers.\u201d Villainous behavior notwithstanding, who would want to go drinking when you could go tippling instead?\n\nThis is an edition of Wednesday Words, NewsFeed\u2019s weekly feature on language.

Most of them declined \u0097 which is a little strange, since the big bad test couldn't possibly hurt Alan Greenspan or Oprah Winfrey. But the SAT occupies a central place in the American psyche, lying at the terrifying intersection of ability, class and pride. As TV's Conan O'Brien put it, \"It has taken 20 years to forget the trauma of that damned test, and looking up my scores would be like going back to Vietnam.\"\n\nThe test's prominence ensures that shouting matches will erupt over it regularly. Usually one side says the SAT should die because it's racist; the other says it should flourish because it maintains standards. Their arguments are important but had started to seem pointless, since the number of SAT takers has increased virtually every year since Pearl Harbor.\n\nThen, in a Feb. 18 speech to his fellow college presidents, the psychologist who runs the University of California suggested something radical: Scrap the thing. Richard Atkinson says the test hurls kids into months of practicing word games and math riddles at the expense of studying chemistry or poetry. He wants to make SAT scores an optional part of the application for all 90,000 kids who want to go to U.C. each year. \"The SATs have acquired a mystique that's clearly not warranted,\" he proclaims. \"Who knows what they measure?\" Those of us who wanted to stick a No. 2 pencil in our eye while puzzling the meaning of \"mendacious\" gave a cheer.\n\nLast week U.C.'s faculty and regents started what will be a long, fiery debate over his proposal. Since Atkinson began attacking the test, college administrators across the U.S. have reopened old fights about the SAT and started new ones. President John Peters of Northern Illinois University says the reaction of the hundreds of college officials to the speech was \"extremely positive\"; he plans to suggest a review of his school's standardized-test requirements at the next faculty meeting. The Georgia board of regents is reviewing admissions criteria, as are the University of Texas, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the College of Wooster in Ohio.\n\nMost universities have no immediate plans to stop asking for SAT scores. But at those schools that were having second thoughts about the test, Atkinson's stance will embolden anti- SAT forces. \"It's gutsy,\" says Florida International University admissions chief Carmen Brown, \"and a lot of other places will follow.\" The College Board, which oversees the SAT, was worried enough after the speech to e-mail colleges a defense of its test.\n\nThe board had plenty of reasons to worry before then. The California rumblings come at a precarious time for the SAT. To be sure, it remains a key part of the college-application process. Last year 44% of the kids who graduated from high school took it, up from 41% in 1995. In all, more than 2 million students took the SAT in 2000. The second-biggest admissions test, the act, had 1.8 million takers last year. Published by an Iowa testing company, the act started as a rival to the SAT and focuses more on subject matter than general reasoning. But the act never developed the sat's aura of quality and rigor. Whenever a college suggests dropping its SAT requirement, traditionalists on campus inevitably say doing so would lower standards.\n\nOver the past few years, however, the test's defenders have started to lose ground. About 280 of the nation's 2,083 four-year colleges and universities make the SAT optional for some or all applicants; a handful of prestigious colleges, including Franklin and Marshall and Mount Holyoke, have joined their ranks since the early '90s and say they aren't admitting idiots as a result. Hamilton College is considering making the SAT optional. Countless other schools have de-emphasized the SAT in more subtle ways \u0097 continuing to ask for scores but weighing other factors more heavily.\n\nGranted many of the SAT-optional schools sit on utopian campuses in liberal New England villages. But it's getting hard to find an admissions officer anywhere who says an SAT score alone tells you anything important. Deans at prestigious, traditional bastions such as Vanderbilt support the SAT, but some of the test's assumed proponents aren't guarding it against the barbarians. Even conservatives at the Weekly Standard have written about how the SAT has \"shaped \u0097 and misshaped \u0097 modern American life.\"\n\nBut if we drop the SAT, by what means should we allot membership in the nation's \u00e9lite? Of course, plenty of people make movies and play in the major leagues and run companies and write for magazines without high SATs. But good scores sure don't hurt. Besides, don't they measure something valuable \u0097 something beyond the diligence it takes to memorize the details of the Franco-Prussian War for a history exam? Much of the debate over the SAT boils down to this: Assuming we can measure innate intelligence, do we want a society that rewards genes? Are we afraid of what kind of society that might be? Or should we instead reward only the achievements of a life \u0097 what we do with our gifts, not what we start with?", "summary": "A growing number of colleges are spurning a test that has measured and mortified Americans for 75 years", "compression": 56.7222222222, "coverage": 0.6666666667, "density": 0.7777777778, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

And Daycare Discover in Chicago boasts on its site: \u201cTraditionally, it takes 45 hours to find a daycare. We\u2019ll do it for you for $150.\u201d\n\nFor kids with packed schedules typical of the upper middle class, there\u2019s even an on-demand ride-and-care service for children in Southern California and the Bay Area called Zum, which resembles Lyft and ferries children from 5 to 15 to and from school or, say, team practice, at prices that start at $16 a ride, with childcare pre- or post-ride at $12 per half hour.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a new America described in Arlie Russell Hochschild\u2019s book the The Outsourced Self: what was once part of private life is now outsourced, and then sold back to desperate consumer parents as high-end expertise.\n\nZoe Hanson could not afford such outsourcing, but she did get help. She found her child a place in a daycare located through NurtureList, which she came upon when one of her acquaintances told her to try a \u201cGolden Gate\u201d mothers\u2019 group which recommended it. A startup based in the Bay Area, NurtureList offers a search engine filled with facilities and fastidious school profiles. Yin Li, the site\u2019s founder, is a San Francisco entrepreneur who says she wants to connect with \u201cchildcare providers and give them a way to get discovered and stand out to parents.\u201d\n\nIn addition to listing daycare openings geographically, the site writes up new schools and, say, unusual programs, like ones that take place outside of preschool. NurtureList and similar sites, such as New York City\u2019s free, public school site, InsideSchools, offer a vision for equalizing childcare access, a central clearing house that not only helps parents in a bind, but might motivate more childcare centers to open their doors.\n\nHanson plugged potential neighborhoods and the age of her daughter into the site to try to locate an available daycare spot. \u201cI was assuming I couldn\u2019t afford anything but an institutional setting for my daughter\u2014a big gray room full of toddlers,\u201d she said. But the Hansons quickly found a place at an in-home daycare center in San Francisco\u2019s Mission area that was Spanish immersion, with home cooked meals. At nearly the same time, Hanson also got a job, as a studio and marketing coordinator at a design and architecture practice.\n\nSo far, however, such databases are only available in wealthy and wired places like San Francisco and New York. But what if free online daycare finders could be popularized in parts of the country where problems accessing daycare availability are also hampering the workforce, as a modest kind of \u201cinequality hack\u201d?\n\n\u201cIf these daycare sites were free and accessible to everyone, the transparency of childcare would increase,\u201d says Hanson. \u201cWhen you are poor person, you are looking for daycare, maybe you don\u2019t have a computer, so you are going on-line in the library or on your phone.

To find the cheapest countries to live in, GoBankingRates ranked nations by four key affordability metrics provided by online pricing database Numbeo:\n\nEven among the 50 cheapest countries, rent is at least 70% cheaper than rent in New York City, groceries are at least 40% cheaper, and consumer goods and services cost less by 30% or more. Local purchasing power does vary greatly among these cheap countries, however.\n\nScroll down to see the countries with the lowest costs, starting with the least cheap up to the lowest-cost country at No. 1.\n\nBelarus is an eastern European country that borders Poland, Ukraine and Russia, and its major industries include metal-cutting machines, tractors and trucks. With about $450 in monthly estimated expenses plus about $440 in monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the center of Minsk, a single person can live comfortably on under $1,000 a month.\n\nRead next: The Hottest Real Estate Markets for the Next Five Years\n\nMonthly expenses for a single person living in Lima, Peru, average around $490, and rent is around $427 for a one-bedroom in the city center. Located on the west coast of South America, Peru has a population of 30.4 million and borders Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia. In addition to famous historical sites like Machu Picchu, Peru is also known for its strong mining, mineral and metals industries.\n\nAnother eastern European nation, Lithuania borders Belarus, Poland and Latvia and is ranked as one of the cheapest countries to live. The Lithuanian population of 2.9 million should benefit from the relatively local purchasing power index, which helps residents\u2019 money go further. Lithuania\u2019s major industries include metal-cutting machinery, electric motors and TVs.\n\nCroatia is located east of the Adriatic Sea across from Italy, offering a picturesque coastline. With a population of 4.5 million, Croatia has a decent local purchasing power, and its main industries include chemicals, plastics and fabricated metal. This country offers cheap living with rent that\u2019s cheaper than rent in most of the 50 countries ranked here. In the capital of Zagreb, for example, a one-bedroom costs just $356 a month.\n\nMorocco is a North African country that borders Algeria and, just across the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain. This country has a population of 33.3 million, and its main industries are aerospace, phosphate mining and processing, and manufacturing automotive parts. In the capital of Rabat, total monthly expenses would come to just $750 for one person.\n\nLocated next to Lithuania and Russia in Eastern Europe, Latvia has a smaller population of just under 2 million with about 32% aged 55 and over. Overall, living in Latvia costs half as much as living in New York City.\n\nPortugal is a western European country located right next to Spain. With a population of 10.8 million, the local purchasing power in this country is closer to New York City\u2019s than many countries in these rankings, which shows local incomes are higher and go further when paying for the country\u2019s cheap goods, groceries and rent.\n\nLocated in Africa and bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Libya and Sudan, Egypt has a higher population of 88.5 million. Tourism is perhaps Egypt\u2019s biggest industry, along with textiles and food processing. Consumer goods and rent are cheaper in Egypt; a one-bedroom in Cairo costs just $350 a month.\n\nArmenia is located in the Middle East between Turkey and Azerbaijan and north of Iran. With a population of about 3.1 million, its biggest industry is diamond processing. Residents of Armenia will get cheaper groceries and pay less for consumer goods compared to many other nations, putting it at No. 42 on this list.\n\nRent and consumer goods are cheaper in the Philippines, which help make it one of the least expensive countries to live. An island nation in Southeast Asia, the Philippines\u2019 climate is tropical, but monsoons are known to occur from time to time. Its major industries include making electronics, garments, footwear and pharmaceuticals.\n\nRead More: The 10 Best States to Visit This Spring\n\nKnown for its jute, cotton, garments and paper industries, Bangladesh is neighbors with India and has a population of 169 million. This country is also known for having mild winters from October to May and hot, humid summers from March to June. Bangladesh has a relatively lower purchasing power, which is likely tied to the nation\u2019s lower GDP per capita ($1,087 in 2014). But, it has the sixth-cheapest rent index of the 50 cheapest countries; a one-bedroom in Dhaka costs just $154 a month.\n\nRussia is fairly average across the categories this survey measured, offering both cheaper prices and a decent local purchasing power. Living in the major Russian cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg will be pricier, however, than living in other cities like Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. With a huge landmass, Russia\u2019s biggest industries center on its natural resources like coal, oil, gas and metals.\n\nWith a population of 9.9 million, Hungary is an eastern European country with strong industries in mining, metallurgy and construction materials. Cheap rent is one of its bigger selling points, with a typical one-bedroom flat in Budapest priced at $363 a month.\n\nSyria, located in the Middle East, is a country in crisis, torn apart by civil war and radical Muslim sects, including ISIS. This crisis has deeply affected the Syrian economy, which has the lowest local purchasing power of any of the 50 cheapest countries listed here. So if you\u2019re hoping to move to Syria, plan on living off of savings rather than earning a living locally. U.S. dollars will go plenty far in Syria, however, which has low costs across the board for rent, consumer goods and groceries.\n\nA European nation bordering Croatia and Austria, Slovenia actually has a higher local purchasing power than most of the 50 cheapest countries. So for ex-pats who earn in the local economy, money will go further. Slovenia has a population of around 2 million and one of the highest per capita GDPs in Central Europe.\n\nGermany is among the top 10 countries for expats, according to an HSBC survey that ranked nations on the economy, experience and family-friendly atmospheres. For those looking for a cheap country where they can earn a good living, Germany is a good bet. Local incomes are high enough that Germans can actually buy 50% more with their earnings than New Yorkers can, which is comparable to many U.S. cities like Baltimore, Md., or Lexington, Ky.\n\nTunisia is a coastal North African nation that borders the Mediterranean Sea, Algeria and Libya and has a population of 11 million. The country offers a low cost of living, particularly cheaper rent \u2014 a one-bedroom in the capital Tunis costs just around $280 a month \u2014 and consumer goods. However, it offers a worse local purchasing power than most other 50 cheapest countries.\n\nWith a population of 48.1 million, Spain\u2019s main industries are textiles, apparel, food and beverages. Spain could be a smart choice for an expat who plans to work in their country of residence, as wages earn locally will give a worker a purchasing power that\u2019s on-par with what New Yorkers earn. Rent costs in some Spain cities, however, are on par with typical rent prices in the U.S. For example, renting a one-bedroom apartment in Madrid could cost you around $800.\n\nEstonia is located just west of Russia and south of Finland, and has a population of 1.3 million. The biggest industries of the Estonian economy are engineering, electronics and wood products, which helps give it a higher GDP per capita of around $20,000, according to numbers from the World Bank. This higher production is the sign of a strong economy, which gives Estonia residents better purchasing power than many other countries among the 50 cheapest.\n\nTurkey lands among the cheapest countries to live or retire thanks to having some of the lowest rent costs among this list of 50. Istanbul rentals will be pricier, but rents in other major Turkish cities \u2014 like Izmir, Bursa and Ankara \u2014 will see cheaper rent prices. With a population of 79.4 million, Turkey\u2019s biggest industries are textiles, food processing and automobiles, which helps this Middle Eastern nation maintain its higher local purchasing power.\n\nRead More: How to Lose a Guy (or Girl) Over Spending Habits\n\nBrazil is a major South American nation with a population of 204.3 million and an economy that centers on the production of textiles, shoes, chemicals, cement and lumber. This country offers decently cheap consumer goods and housing. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, a one-bedroom apartment will set you back only $540 or so. And with a mostly tropical climate, Brazil could even be a retiree\u2019s dream vacation.\n\nBordering Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Georgia has a population of 4.9 million. This nation has some of the lowest consumer and grocery prices of any country. In the country\u2019s capital, Tbilisi, the monthly expenses for a single person amount to around $360 a month. These low costs are, however, matched with low local incomes. Despite strong steel, machinery and electrical appliance industries, Georgia has a low GDP per capita of just $3,670, according to the World Bank.\n\nNepal has the second-lowest local purchasing power of any nation on this list, which squares with the nation\u2019s GDP per capita that\u2019s just over $700, according to World Bank data. For Americans looking to stretch savings in a country with dirt-cheap living expenses, however, Nepal will still be an attractive choice. It has the lowest rents of any nation surveyed, with a one-bedroom in Kathmandu priced at just $109 a month. The costs of groceries and consumer goods are also low.\n\nAlbania is a European country located just north of Greece with plenty of coastline along the Mediterranean Sea and a population of 3 million. The country\u2019s biggest industries are food, tobacco products, textiles and clothing. Though the nation has a lower local purchasing power than most of the 50 cheapest countries, Albania offers low prices on groceries, rent and consumer services or goods, with the cost for all of these totaling around $630 in the country\u2019s capital, Tirana.\n\nMontenegro is a small neighbor of Albania and Serbia, located next to the Adriatic Sea. About 650,000 live in this country, which has strong metal and agricultural processing industries. Montenegro has a local purchasing power that\u2019s around the middle of the pack for the 50 cheapest countries. Its prices are also some of the lowest of the countries surveyed, particularly on groceries.\n\nThis North African country borders the Mediterranean Sea, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya. With a population of 39.5 million, consumer goods are cheap in this nation. Not including rent, a single person\u2019s monthly costs come out to just under $400 in Algiers, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nUkraine is another eastern European nation situated next to Russia and the Black Sea. About 44.4 million people live in Ukraine, whose industries include coal, electric power, chemicals and more. Local incomes are still low, which gives it one of the lowest purchasing powers of the 50 cheapest countries. Despite this, cheaper groceries and consumer goods put Ukraine at No. 24. In fact, residents in its capital, Kiev, face typical expenses of around $325 a month per person, excluding rent.\n\nAzerbaijan is a Middle East country that borders Iran, Armenia and Georgia, and has a population of 9.8 million people. The biggest drivers of the country\u2019s economy are its rich resources, including petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas. This country has some of the lowest prices on groceries and consumer goods, which makes it one of the cheapest places to live. For example, Baku, its capital, has a cost of living that\u2019s 70% lower than New York City.\n\nMexico lands at No. 22 among the cheapest countries thanks to costs that are low relative to incomes. Costs are relatively low in this country, especially for rent and consumer services and goods. In the Mexican cities Merida and Queretaro, for example, monthly expenses add up to a little over $400.\n\nRomania is an eastern European nation that has a population of 21.7 million. This country\u2019s major industries include footwear, textiles and electric machinery. Rent is cheaper in this country than many other of the 50 cheapest countries. For instance, the rent in the capital of Bucharest is about $364 a month for a one-bedroom apartment. Consumer goods and groceries are also low-cost in Romania.\n\nRead More: 10 Ways to Make Your First Billion Dollars\n\nThe biggest factor that put Bulgaria among the cheapest countries to live is its low rent costs. In Varna, one of Bulgaria\u2019s largest cities, rent is $232 a month for a one-bedroom apartment. Food and consumer goods are also cheaper in Bulgaria than most other countries in these rankings. Located in Europe, Bulgaria borders Greece, Turkey and Romania, and has a population of 7.2 million. Its major industries include electricity, gas, food, beverages and tobacco.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Mediterranean with plenty of coastlines and islands, Greece is a major tourist destination that offers a picturesque setting at a low cost. Greece has a higher purchasing power and one of the lowest rents of any of the cheapest countries, with a median price to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Patras around $240 a month. Food and consumer goods are pricier compared to the other 49 cheapest countries, however. Greece has also faced a lot of economic turbulence due to huge government debts, which can mean unsure banking and financial services for those who move to Greece.\n\nSerbia is a European country with a population of 7.2 million, and its major industries include automobiles, base metals and furniture. Serbia has the third-lowest rent index of the 50 cheapest countries, with typical costs for a one-bedroom apartment around $170 a month in Novi Sad. The country has low-cost groceries and consumer goods, though it also has a lower local purchasing power.\n\nThe most favorable cost factor that put Malaysia among the cheapest countries is its better-than-average local purchasing power, which is evidence of a strong local economy. The Southeast Asian country has a population of 30.5 million, and its major industries center on processing and manufacturing rubber and palm products.\n\nChile is a South American country that stretches along the continent\u2019s west coast and has a population of 17.5 million. Chile\u2019s biggest industries are minerals, including lithium and copper. The country ranks favorably thanks to a higher local purchasing power that\u2019s not far behind that of New York City, as well as lower costs in rent, groceries and more.\n\nMoldova is a cheap country that offers some of the lowest prices on groceries and consumer goods. In Chisinau, average monthly expenses for a single person are around $330 a month, and rent is also cheap at around $200 a month for a single-bedroom apartment. An eastern European country, Moldova has 3.5 million residents, and its main industries are sugar, vegetable oil and other foods.\n\nPakistan is located west of India and south of Afghanistan. It has a population of nearly 200 million people, with its strongest industries including manufacturing of textiles and apparel, food processing and pharmaceuticals. Living in Pakistan is pretty affordable, especially if you move to the city Lahore. Combined typical costs of rent, food and other goods and services for a month come out to about $530 a month.\n\nColombia offers low costs across the board, from rent to groceries and other goods. A typical one-bedroom in Medellin, for example, is priced around $140 a month while other expenses add just around $350 a month. Located in northern South America, Colombia has a population of 46.7 million, and its main industries include textiles, food and oil.\n\nPoland has one of the higher local purchasing powers of the 50 cheapest countries. Any incomes earned locally will go further, especially with the country\u2019s lower grocery and consumer goods costs. Poland has a population of 38.6 million, and its main industries are iron and steel manufacturing, coal mining and machine building.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a European nation that borders Croatia and Serbia, and has a population of 3.9 million. Its main industries are minerals and metals, including steel, coal, iron ore, lead and zinc. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a decent local purchasing power, as well as low prices on rent, groceries and consumer goods. In the capital of Sarajevo, for example, the combined monthly costs of rent and other expenses is just around $600-$700.\n\nRounding out the top 10 of the cheapest countries to live in or retire is Macedonia, which has one of the lowest rents of the 50 cheapest countries. Groceries and consumer goods also cheap, which keeps costs low despite a middling local purchasing power. Macedonia is a European nation located just north of Greece and has a smaller population of 2.1 million. Its main industries are textiles, food processing and oil.\n\nThe Czech Republic lands at No. 9 thanks to a balance between lower costs and a higher local purchasing power. This European country borders Germany, Austria and Poland, and has a population of 10.6 million. It has a higher GDP per capita (around $19,500), according to the World Bank, which means that locals can buy more with their incomes.\n\nA South American nation with a population of 6.8 million, Paraguay\u2019s main industries include sugar, cement and textiles. The country has low costs across the board on rent, grocery and consumer goods. In the nation\u2019s capital, Asunci\u00f3n, monthly expenses for a single person are just around $360 month, and rent for a single-bedroom flat is about $250.\n\nOman is a small nation with a population of 3.3 million that borders Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Sea. Like many of its Middle Eastern neighbors, Oman is rich in oil and gas resources that make it a wealthy nation that has the highest local purchasing power in the top 50.\n\nZambia actually has the highest rent of any of the 50 countries in these rankings. Yet, this African nation landed at No. 6 among the cheapest countries thanks to its high local purchasing powers. For those looking to relocate to a cheaper country, Zambia would offer both lower costs and local incomes high enough to help cover expenses.\n\nKazakhstan borders Russia and China, and has a population of 18.2 million people. The local economy relies on Kazakhstan\u2019s natural resources like oil, coal and iron ore. Kazakhstan\u2019s cheap living is most apparent in its costs for groceries and consumer goods, which are lower than most of the 50 cheapest nations.\n\nGroceries are more expensive in this desert country than most other cheapest countries, as are consumer goods. But this Middle Eastern nation is fairly wealthy, thanks to its strong oil industry centered on crude oil, petroleum refining and petrochemicals. Plus, Saudi Arabia has a higher GDP per capita of $24,161, according to the World Bank. This helps give Saudi Arabia a local purchasing power that even beats out New York City.\n\nKosovo is located in Eastern Europe and borders Serbia, Albania and Macedonia. It has a population of 1.9 million, and mineral mining and construction materials are the major industries in Kosovo. When it comes to costs, Kosovo scores the best on consumer goods and groceries \u2014 in the capital of Pristina, expenses for a single person are just $324 a month. Rent costs are also low at just $275 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nIndia is the most populous country among the 50 cheapest, home to 1.25 billion residents. Its major industries include textiles, chemicals and food processing. India also has a relatively high local purchasing power in the major cities surveyed. Living in India can be cheap; it has the second-lowest rent index of the 50 cheapest countries (after neighbor Nepal). India also has some of the lowest prices for consumer goods and groceries, with typical monthly expenses for these priced around $285 a month for a single person living in Kolkata.\n\nSouth Africa is the cheapest country to live or retire. It\u2019s also the world\u2019s largest producer of platinum, gold and chromium, which goes far to enrich the country and its economy. This resulted in a local purchasing power that\u2019s significantly higher than what New Yorkers face, which is the most favorable factor that puts South Africa at No. 1.\n\nAlong with a higher local purchasing power, South Africa also offers lower prices on consumer goods and groceries, and rent costs that are typical of the 50 cheapest countries. In the major city of Cape Town, for instance, monthly expenses total just under $400 while the average rent costs are reflected by the typical price to rent a one-bedroom in Durban of around $280 a month.\n\nHere are the full rankings for all 112 countries surveyed by GOBankingRates, from the least expensive at No. 1 to the most expensive.\n\nKeep Reading: 10 Best and Worst Things to Do When Looking for a Place to Retire\n\nMethodology: GOBankingRates generated these rankings based on cost of living indices sourced from online pricing database Numbeo.com. This study surveyed cost indicators for major cities in the 112 nations for which Numbeo had recent and accurate data, using the median cost indicators of the cities to generate a typical cost index for the country. In countries where information was only available for a single city, that city\u2019s data was used. GOBankingRates measured each country\u2019s performance on four key data points: (1) the country\u2019s local purchasing power, which measures the local buying power of typical incomes; (2) cost index of consumer goods and services; (3) cost index of rents; and (4) cost index of groceries. Countries were scored on the relative favorability of these factors, with each weighted equally, and ranked according to these scores. Additional details about the countries and certain cities were sourced from Numbeo.com (from Jan. 28, 2016, to Feb. 9, 2016) or the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s The World Factbook unless otherwise stated.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GoBankingRates.", "summary": "Time for a change of scene?", "compression": 623.5714285714, "coverage": 0.5714285714, "density": 0.8571428571, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Whether or not the pipeline is built, the oil sands crude will flow.\n\n(VIDEO: Pipeline Politics: Backgrounding Keystone XL)\n\nNow it\u2019s important to realize that the SEIS is not the final word on the pipeline\u2014something the otherwise completely unhelpful State Department officials on the press call this afternoon took great pains to point out. \u201cThis is a draft,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Kerri-Ann Jones. \u201cWe are anxious to have public comment.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll get it. The SEIS will be subject to at least 45 days of public comment after it is published next Friday in the Federal Register, during which State will have to sift through hundreds of thousands of opinions, along with the more than 1.4 million emails and letters they\u2019ve received from the public and other government agencies so far. State will also have to undertake a separate analysis on whether Keystone is in the national interest, which will involve more comment over 90 days. And eventually\u2014though probably not anytime soon\u2014the President will finally have to decide whether he\u2019s willing to let Keystone be built or not.\n\nFrom a climate perspective, though, the SEIS seems to indicate that Obama\u2019s decision won\u2019t make much of a difference at all, largely because much of the oil could be shipped by other pipelines or increasingly by rail. (Or it could end up shipped to China via Canada\u2019s West Coast ports.) The report estimates that if the Keystone pipeline is not built\u2014but other pipelines in the future are\u2014oil sands production would fall by just 0.4 to 0.6% by 2030. Even if all pipeline capacity is restricted in the future, including Keystone, oil sands production would fall just 2 to 4% by 2030. That barely makes a difference on carbon emissions. State estimates that crude from oil sands produces about 17% higher greenhouse gas emissions over its life-cycle than an equivalent barrel of conventional crude. If Keystone is denied, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to increase by just 70,000 to 830,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent a year. Even if all pipelines are restricted, emissions would increase by 350,000 metric tons CO2e to 5.3 million metric tons. At the high end, that would be equal to taking 1 million cars off the road, but it\u2019s hardly the end game for the planet. As Ed Crooks of the Financial Times pointed out on Twitter, stopping Keystone would cut U.S. emissions by just 0.001%-0.01%.\n\n(MORE: Keystone: How Bill McKibben Turned a Pipeline into an Environmental Rallying Point)\n\nThere was something of a bright side for environmentalists. As Juliet Elperin of the Washington Post noted, the report undercut the argument from the oil industry that the pipeline itself was all that necessary:\n\nBut the detailed environmental report \u2014 which runs close to 2,000 pages long \u2014 also questions one of the strongest arguments for the pipeline, by suggesting America can meet its energy needs over the next decade without it. The growth in rail transport of oil from western Canada and the Bakken Formation on the Great Plains and other pipelines, the analysis says, could meet the country\u2019s energy needs for the next decade, even if Keystone XL never gets built.\n\nStill, environmentalists\u2014many of whom have taken part in major public protests over the pipeline, including a recent event outside the White House\u2014were furious about the report. They focused on the argument that the oil sands will develop whether or not the pipeline is actually built, noting that both the oil industry and the Canadian government have fought hard to get Keystone approved in recent years. While it is entirely possible that Canada could and will choose to ship its oil sands crude to Asia, that would require a another pipeline that some native groups in Canada have opposed in the past. Railroads are an option as well, but cargo lines are already jammed with product, even as U.S. producers in the northern Midwest pump more and more oil themselves. \u201cThe conclusion that this project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development of the oil sands is a conclusion that is not shared by Canadian industry,\u201d said Bill McKibben, the head of the environmental group 350.org and a leader of the anti-Keystone movement. \u201cThey call it Keystone for a reason.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re going to be talking about Keystone for a long time, so I\u2019ll just note a few things in conclusion. One is that the way the State Department handled the release of the SEIS\u2014dumped at the end of a Friday, giving reporters and environmentalists almost no time to digest the document\u2014is emblematic of the way the Obama Administration has dealt with Keystone. Politically this is a no-win situation for the President\u2014no matter which decision he makes, he\u2019ll piss off a good chunk of Americans. But it\u2019s impossible to avoid the conclusion that the White House is trying to drag this decision-making process out for as long as possible. Not a profile in courage.\n\n(MORE: Pipeline Politics: Keystone, Advocates and Analysts)\n\nSecond, I understand why the environmental movement has chosen to make its stand on Keystone. My colleague Michael Grunwald made a pretty good case for this strategy in TIME:\n\nKeystone isn\u2019t the best fight to have over fossil fuels, but it\u2019s the fight we\u2019re having. Now is the time to choose sides. It\u2019s always easy to quibble with the politics of radical protest: Did ACT UP need to be so obnoxious? Didn\u2019t the tax-evasion optics of the Boston Tea Party muddle the anti-imperial message? But if we\u2019re in a war to stop global warming\u2013a war TIME declared on a green-bordered cover five years ago\u2013then we need to fight it on the beaches, the landing zones and the carbon-spewing tar sands of Alberta. If we\u2019re serious about reducing atmospheric carbon below 350 parts per million, we need to start leaving some carbon in the ground.\n\nNonetheless, if the State Department numbers hold up, environmentalists will have to double down on the symbolic rationale for fighting Keystone\u2014because the data will not be with them. It\u2019s worth noting that the same day that the SEIS was released, the Sierra Club and Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that their alliance had helped lead to the retirement of 54 gigawatts of dirty coal power. That\u2019s a huge amount of carbon emissions averted\u2014far more than the Keystone pipeline would ever be responsible for. That\u2019s a meaningful victory that dwarfs the bad news from the State Department.\n\nThe reality is that oil\u2014of any form\u2014is going to be the hardest source of carbon to fight. Coal can be replaced relatively easily with other sources of cleaner electricity, including natural gas, renewables and nuclear. (Indeed, more wind and solar capacity were installed in the U.S. last year than all fossil fuel sources combined.) But right now we have virtually no substitute for oil as a transport fuel, save some biofuels, which in many ways are not better. (Battery-powered transport is still in the pilot stage.) That means until we can address the demand for oil\u2014as we\u2019re doing with efficiency and more slowly with substitutes\u2014trying to restrict the supply of oil, especially without a carbon price, will be incredibly difficult. Oil remains too valuable and too fungible\u2014two things coal is not.\n\nEnvironmentalists can and will continue their fight against Keystone\u2014just because there\u2019s more progress to be made against coal doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do both. As Grist\u2019s David Roberts suggested on Twitter, environmentalists need to figure out a way to flip the switch\u2014to make stopping new fossil fuel developments the default, instead of the other way around. But today\u2019s SEIS demonstrates why it will be an uphill battle. Not that greens are used to any other kind.\n\nBryan Walsh is a senior editor at TIME. Find him on Twitter at @bryanrwalsh.

And how low can you get that barrel of oil?\n\nWTI has declined to $30 per barrel, the lowest level in more than 12 years. But heavy oil producers in Canada would love to have $30 oil.\n\nThe price for a barrel of bitumen, the tar-like oil sands that comes from Alberta, fell to just over $8 per barrel this week. That is not a typo. Bitumen traded at $8.35 per barrel on Tuesday.\n\nIn fact, Amazon.com sells oil drums \u2013 just the barrel, not the oil \u2013 for $78, almost ten times the cost of the actual bitumen. To be fair, that drum holds 55 gallons instead of the industry-usual 42 gallons.

That is because heavy oil is some of the costliest stuff around. Bitumen production is way more expensive than oil from shale.\n\nHeavy oil producers are now losing money on every single barrel that they sell, even from facilities that are already up and running. Forget the fixed costs of development; just the operating costs of keeping a project online are significantly higher than the revenue that an oil sands producer would earn from selling their bitumen.\n\nConsequently, it is shut-in time for some producers. Leaving aside the massive cutbacks in spending and the future oil production that will not be realized, Canada could start posting some serious production declines from existing sources. Simply shutting down an operation probably makes more sense than selling oil at a loss.\n\nBut some companies might stay online and lose money because shutting down carries its own trouble and costs. Shutting down can actually damage a reservoir, leaving a site with permanently lower output.

The Americans set a national record in the final with a time of 37.04 seconds.\n\nThe other U.S. team members losing medals are Trell Kimmons, Justin Gatlin, Ryan Bailey, Jeffery Demps and Darvis Patton. Kimmons, Gatlin and Bailey ran in the final with Gay.\n\nGatlin, who is in Qatar for the opening Diamond League meet of the season on Friday, told the AP he was not aware of the decision and had no comment. Gatlin, who won the 100-meter gold medal at the 2004 Athens Games, served a four-year doping ban from 2006.\n\nGay tested positive for steroids at the U.S. championships in 2013. He received a reduced suspension \u2014 rather than a two-year ban \u2014 because he cooperated with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s investigation that led to an eight-year ban for his former coach, Jon Drummond.\n\nGay\u2019s results were annulled going back to July 15, 2012, the date when he first used a product containing a banned substance.\n\nIf the London medals are reallocated, the silver will go to Trinidad and Tobago, which finished third in 38.12 seconds. The bronze would go to the French team which placed fourth in 38.16 seconds.\n\nThe rules of track and field\u2019s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, mandated that the entire U.S. team be disqualified, but the final decision was up to the IOC.\n\nDrummond was the coach of the U.S. relay team in London and placed Gay on the team. According to the USADA decision in Drummond\u2019s case, the athlete took a banned substance in July 2012 with the coach\u2019s knowledge.\n\nThe IOC has previously stripped U.S. relay teams of medals retroactively for doping, including three teams from the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. was stripped of gold in the women\u2019s 4\u00d7400 and bronze in the 4\u00d7100 following Marion Jones\u2019 admission of doping. Jones returned her medals, but her teammates appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to keep theirs and won their case in 2010. The court said IAAF rules at the time did not allow entire teams to be disqualified because of doping by one athlete.\n\nThe IOC also stripped the U.S. men\u2019s 4\u00d7400 relay of their Sydney gold after a doping admission by Antonio Pettigrew.\n\nIn 2012, American runner Crystal Cox was stripped of her gold medal from the 4\u00d7400 relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics after admitting to doping. The IOC did not disqualify the rest of the team because it was unclear which rules were in effect at the time.\n\nAP Sports Writer Gerald Imray in Doha, Qatar, contributed to this report.", "summary": "Entire men's sprint relay team stripped of silver medal from London 2012", "compression": 59.0769230769, "coverage": 0.9230769231, "density": 2.1538461538, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Before last fall, Air Force regulations pertaining to the enlistment oath noted that \u201cairmen may omit the words `So help me God\u2019, if desired for personal reasons.\u201d\n\nBut the Air Force modified that section last Oct. 30, according to Miller, and eliminated that option:\n\nMiller says she finds the Air Force\u2019s position surprising, because she handled a similar case last year for someone based at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. \u201cThey said they\u2019d consulted their legal department, which confirmed that they could not require an atheist to say that language,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cSo it was very puzzling to us when this issue came up again a year later and the Air Force had a completely different response.\u201d\n\nEugene Fidell, who lectures on military law at Yale University and co-founded the National Institute of Military Justice, says it shouldn\u2019t take long for the Department of Defense general counsel to strike down the requirement that airmen declare \u201cso help me God\u201d when they re-up. \u201cThat provision cannot be considered mandatory,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a test oath, and test oaths are forbidden by Article 6 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line of Article 6: \u201c\u2026no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\u201d", "summary": "Lawsuit threatened unless mandatory oath invoking `God\u2019 is changed", "compression": 64.0, "coverage": 0.6, "density": 0.6, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

According to new research from Pew, 57% of riders, regardless of political affiliation, who have heard of the regulatory controversies don\u2019t believe ride hailing services like Uber and Lyft should be regulated like taxis.

They\u2019re also twice as likely to identify as liberal than conservative. Yet across party lines, the anti-regulatory sentiment reigns supreme (though right-leaning riders are more likely than their left-leaning counterparts to take an anti-regulation stance).\n\nThe study also looked at whether users consider drivers to be employees or independent contractors, another major battle the likes of Uber are waging in court right now. And it appears that users do think of the services as essentially different from a typical transportation enterprise, with 66% stating they view workers as independent contractors, and not employees.\n\nStill, \u201cusers also expect ride-hailing companies to play a hands-on role in some traditional employer behaviors, such as making sure that drivers are trained appropriately and generally vouching for the overall customer experience.\u201d\n\n(Of course, if Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicles pan out, they may not need to worry about the stipulations much longer.)", "summary": "No matter what side of the political aisle they're on.", "compression": 31.75, "coverage": 0.5833333333, "density": 0.75, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Everything that I\u2019ve been on on HBO I\u2019ve had to audition for: Bessie, The Night Of, Boardwalk Empire, The Wire. The caliber of writers I got to work with early on in my career\u2014David Simon\u2014that kind of just sets the tone for your appetite.\n\nThe show deals with bias against black Americans and Muslim Americans. What effect do you think the show will have on the conversation about race?\n\nIn my perspective, the show has very little to do with race, and everything to do with class. I\u2019ve come to realize that the race thing is a smoke screen. The real war is a war on class. It\u2019s about how much green you have in your pocket. In this country, you can unfortunately literally get away with murder if you have enough political background behind you. You are innocent until proven poor.\n\nYou\u2019ve also addressed the failures of the system on your Vice show Black Market. How did that show come to be?\n\nI got a phone call from Spike Jonze. When I get there, he and his team were talking to me like I was this \u00fcbersmart person, and I was just smiling and nodding my head and freaking out on the inside. But once someone in the room said, \u201cBlack Market to us means when the system fails you, you create your own system,\u201d a lightbulb went off in my head. I was just like, Oh, I get it now. I thought about my mom. I\u2019m first-generation Bahamian, and at my dinner table it was a big deal when you got your green card. And we did whatever we had to do to get our green card.\n\nWhat have been the most personally affecting stories?\n\nOne young man was wearing a mask during the interview. After we shut the cameras down, he takes his mask off, and this 23-year-old boy looks at me and says, \u201cYo, Omar, take me with you, man. I\u2019m tired of this. I don\u2019t want to die out here in these streets.\u201d Six months later, sure enough, he died on those streets. One afternoon, him and his grandmother got shot up.\n\nOn the first episode of Black Market, you mention that when you were on The Wire, the lines blurred between your life and Omar\u2019s. Could you explain?\n\nThe Wire was my breakout. And I\u2019m beginning now to finally deal with what is a self-esteem issue. Growing up, I got picked on a lot. I was the corny one. I was not popular with the ladies. In a very alpha-male community, being sensitive is not considered a quality. Omar became an alter ego. A gay man who doesn\u2019t like fancy clothes or fancy cars, doesn\u2019t do drugs, doesn\u2019t even curse and robs the most gangster drug dealers in the community. He\u2019s an outcast, and I identified with that immensely. Instead of using it as a tool to maybe heal myself, I hid behind that. Nobody was calling Michael in the streets. Everything was Omar, Omar, Omar. I mistook that admiration. It felt good. But it wasn\u2019t for me. It was for a fictional character. When that show ended, along with that character, I was clueless about how to deal with that. I crumbled.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that the identity crisis led you to experiment with cocaine.\n\nThe darkness that was on him, I wore. I dressed like him, walked like him, blew all this money.

TIME foreign affairs columnist Ian Bremmer spoke with Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, about how she would change the UN:\n\nWhat is the single most important thing that a UN Secretary General can do to make the United Nations a more effective institution?\n\nDeepen the trust among Member States, and between Member States and the UN as an institution. The UN is tasked with many responsibilities, including engaging in active preventive diplomacy, running outstanding field operations, creating the context for ambitious multilateral achievements, and delivering on programs across the many focus areas that have been mandated by governments. None of these can be delivered without trust. In the lead up to the Paris Agreement, we used to say that our three priorities were trust, trust and trust. This is because as deeper trust was established and carefully built, new types of conversations became possible and the elusive common ground began to emerge and grow. My vision is of a United Nations that Member States and citizens everywhere fully trust to help the international community avoid war, to excel at seeding and keeping peace where it is needed, and to foster breakthrough agreements and partnerships that improve people\u2019s lives today and give them greater hope for the future.\n\nWhat aspect of the UN\u2019s work do you believe is in greatest need of reform?\n\nLast year, the UN supported Member States to reach three breakthrough multilateral agreements that, taken together, lead us towards a more secure and prosperous future for all. These have become known as \u201cAgenda 2030\u201d. As a consequence of its own success, the UN as an institution now needs to reorganize around the inspiring goals that these agreements established, and ensure that it has the resources and capacity to ensure they are delivered. Many suggestions have been made about the specific reforms that might be needed \u2013 for example, the appointment of a Deputy Secretary General who is exclusively focused on Sustainable Development, or the establishment of a Sustainable Development Board to oversee the UN\u2019s 27 development programs, funds and specialized agencies; ensuring that they all pull in the same direction. An early task for the next Secretary General will be to consider the merits of these suggestions and come to a view about what\u2019s needed. But what\u2019s clear is that, with the negotiating phase now behind us, the UN must step confidently forward into this new era, pull together much more closely and gear up for the on-the-ground delivery of Agenda 2030.\n\nYou\u2019ve written of the need for greater UN investment in \u201cearly-warning\u201d of potential conflicts. What are the most important tell-tale signs of impending violence, and how can the UN use these to prevent conflict?\n\nThere are many factors that are linked to the likelihood of conflict: demographic shifts, exposure to fluctuating global commodity prices, economic performance and levels of inequality, a State\u2019s human rights record, security of access to vital resources, and communities\u2019 vulnerability to natural shocks like drought \u2013 to name but a few. The ongoing build up of adverse factors \u2013 to use the analogy of fire \u2013 is like the build up of large stocks of biomass. While lightning will not necessarily strike this year or next, still the build up of that biomass creates an ever-present risk; just one spark can, at any moment, tip the whole situation into conflict. Early warning systems are there to monitor the overall build up of that biomass; it does not help us to track some tell-tale signs, but not others. Rather, the UN system, working very closely with regional organisations, must continually scan and analyze the full range of data available; always on the look-out for the build up of risk.\n\nThere are several ways in which the UN can use this information to prevent conflict. In the short term, the UN can engage in preventative diplomacy; supporting States to alleviate and de-escalate key risk factors, where it notes that these are building up. For example, where particular communities are facing increasing water insecurity, the UN might support the host country and its neighbors to reach a trans-boundary water sharing agreements that ensures people\u2019s immediate needs are met. In the longer term, there is much that the UN can do to prevent conflict too \u2013 for example, accompanying countries in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda to ensure that societies everywhere are more prosperous, resource secure and resilient to shocks.\n\nWhat is the most important obstacle to the effectiveness of the Security Council, and what you do to overcome this obstacle?\n\nThe Security Council is at its most effective when its 15 Members share a common perspective on an emerging situation and can rapidly agree on what they see as the necessary course of action. But as we all know, it is rarely that simple. Given the complexity of many of the threats to peace and security that we see playing out today, and the different worldviews that come together on the Council \u2013 is it any wonder that a consensus position often takes time to emerge? This is not to excuse inaction \u2013 we are all shamed by the suffering we see in our world today and must do more to ensure people everywhere are safe and that their human rights are being honored. It is easy to say that there is no simple, quick solution to improving the effectiveness of the Security Council \u2013 but there are things that the Secretary-General can do. I would work tirelessly to ensure that many issues never need come before the Security Council \u2013 raising emerging threats early and lending my good offices to resolve a dispute before it becomes a conflict. Should this fail, I would not hesitate to bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in my opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. While the Security Council deliberated on the matter and what must be done, I would act as a trusted, impartial go-between for the various members, listening to their perspectives and giving 100% to building bridges between them in service of a swift and effective response.\n\nNo institution can be all things to all people. What things do you believe the UN should avoid trying to do?\n\nI believe the UN needs to act as a locus for agreement and as a catalyst for action; creating a favourable context for agreement among Member States, and mobilising a wide range of actors to deliver those agreements. While the UN system can and must align itself to help them deliver, it should not bear the full weight of delivery alone. The private sector, investors, civil society and many other stakeholders are very able to play their part; often having better access to capital flows and delivery infrastructure, including supply chains, than the UN. This approach is what I refer to as the new \u201ccollaborative diplomacy\u201d; inviting the contribution of others and blending the best of governmental and non-government \u2013 recognizing that more can be achieved through the collaboration of all.\n\nWhat specifically would you do as Secretary-General to help women and girls around the world to achieve their human potential?\n\nWomen\u2019s rights would be a key focus of my work as SG, and I would make this an overarching issue for all UN bodies to give special attention to. There have been some areas of improvement in women\u2019s rights globally in recent years, but overall progress has been limited, and significant inequalities and injustices based on gender persist globally. This is both unforgivable and a loss for all of us (not just women), as we all miss out when over 50% of the human population is not supported to achieve its full potential. Evidence shows, for example, that improving gender equality in all sectors can contribute to greater global peace and prosperity. There are many things that I would seek to do on this issue as SG. Firstly, I would strengthen the foundations upon which women\u2019s potential can flourish by promoting wider and stronger adherence to the UN Declaration on Human Rights and by implementing the 2030 Agenda \u2013 many aspects of which are relevant to women in particular. And secondly, I would make a concerted push on particular issues, including: providing greater aid to displaced women across the world (the vast majority of refugees and displaced people are women) \u2013 and putting additional safeguards in place to prevent them from being abused, and involving women in political negotiations and peacekeeping efforts.", "summary": "Seeking the UN's top job", "compression": 270.5, "coverage": 0.3333333333, "density": 0.6666666667, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "skipped", "annotator": "ML+WL", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The herald angels sing, \u201cGlory to the higher yields Fed chair Janet Yellen will bring.\u201d\n\nIn a move precipitated by an improving job market and decent economic growth, the Federal Open Markets Committee decided to raise short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point from basically zero.\n\nThat\u2019s where the bellwether Federal Funds rate, which is what banks charge one another on overnight loans, has stood for seven years. The last time the Fed increased borrowing costs was before the start of the global financial crisis in 2006, at the start of George W. Bush\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cGiven the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent,\u201d the FOMC said today.\n\nToday\u2019s move follows months of speculation about when the central bank would act, especially following the Fed\u2019s decision in September to leave rates untouched amid concerns over the strength of the global economy.\n\nHere at home, though, the nation\u2019s employment picture has markedly improved over the past three months, with monthly job gains averaging 218,000. And the so-called core CPI inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, hit 2% in November.\n\nWhile the Fed feels the pressure to raise rates to historically normal levels, it doesn\u2019t have to do so at an accelerated pace. In a speech earlier this month, Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned that \u201can abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession.\u201d\n\nEven though market watchers (including MONEY) have been saying for at least half a decade that rates can\u2019t stay this low for this long, today\u2019s move likely won\u2019t augur pre-recession levels.\n\n\u201cThis interest rate hike is the first element of what is likely to be a very shallow path that would end up constituting the \u2018loosest tightening\u2019 in the modern history of the Fed,\u201d says Allianz chief economic adviser Mohamed A.

The reason: Bond prices fall when market rates rise.\n\nTo find out how much your bond fund is likely to drop in price, you can look up the fund\u2019s \u201cduration\u201d. This figure (which you can check at Morningstar.com) reflects how sensitive a bond fund is to interest rate fluctuations. So Vanguard Total Bond Fund, with an average duration of 5.7, would fall about 5.7% with a 1% increase.\n\nBut as Chris Cook, president of Beacon Capital Management, told MONEY\u2019s Carla Fried, bond fund owners aren\u2019t in for that big a scare in this type of rate environment.\n\n\u201cThe majority of your total return comes from the yield, not price changes,\u201d says Cook. \u201cYour rising income payouts will soon make up for any price drops.\u201d\n\nAlso keep in mind that the Fed only set the yields on short-term borrowing costs, not on long-term yields. One scenario is that \u201cthe Fed raises short rates, yet there\u2019s no sign of inflation,\u201d which affects long rates, says Mark Luschini, strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott. If that happens, demand for longer-term bonds could rise, actually pushing long-term prices higher despite the rate hike.\n\nFinally, remember that you don\u2019t invest in bonds simply for high returns, notes Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, but rather as a ballast in volatile times. When stocks fell more than 50% during the great recession, short-term Treasuries increased by 9%.\n\nSavers have endured a miserable time ever since the Great Recession. In MONEY\u2019s Best Banks package, we found that the average brick-and-mortar savings account yields only 0.08% interest on a $10,000 balance \u2014 or $8 bucks a year. So higher borrowing costs should provide a salve.\n\n\u201cWe view the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision as an unequivocal positive for both long-term investors and for savers,\u201d says Vanguard.\n\nUnfortunately banks take eight months, on average, to increase interest on a money market account following a Federal Reserve hike and 14 months for interest checking, per a 2013 Fed study. Nevertheless, expect your CDs and savings accounts to do add more to your wealth over the next couple of years.\n\nThose who plan to borrow money, say for a home or auto loan, theoretically should be less happy about the move. Higher interest rates means the cost of financing a loan will increase. The average 30-year fixed rate loan comes with a 3.9% in November, per Freddie Mac, compared to 6.2% in six years earlier.\n\n\u201cMortgage rates remain very affordable by historical norms,\u201d says Chris Heller, chief executive of Keller Williams.\n\nDespite all of the Sturm Und Drang about today\u2019s announcement, the amount you pay for most of your loans shouldn\u2019t really change.\n\n\u201cA rate hike will mean higher earnings on savings and higher interest charges on loans \u2014 however expected changes have already been accounted for in most loans,\u201d says NerdWallet\u2019s Sean McQuay. \u201cAs a result, mortgage, student, and auto loan rates should remain largely the same.\u201d\n\nThose who carry a balance on their credit cards, however, might feel a bit more pain, although not much more. NerdWallet estimates that the average indebted household, which carries more than $15,000 in debt, will have to pay $125 more in interest payments over the next five years.", "summary": "The Fed finally raised rates.
