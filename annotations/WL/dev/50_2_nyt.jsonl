As a Catholic schoolgirl, she dreamed of becoming a flight attendant or a nun. Instead, her name became synonymous with a specific kind of sword-swallowing prowess, an erotic subspecialty she made all her own in the landmark 1972 skinflick ''Deep Throat.'' You don't need to have seen a frame of the movie to be familiar with its ingenious, if ludicrous, premise: a woman is unable to achieve orgasm until a sympathetic doctor discovers that her clitoris resides in her throat. His ''treatment'' called upon Lovelace to perform hitherto unimaginable feats of fellatio -- the more pleasure her character wants to feel, the more oral satisfaction she has to provide. Having been taught by her husband and manager, Chuck Traynor, to suppress her gag reflex, Lovelace, then in her early 20's, was shown in repeated close-ups following the doctor's advice to lengths that did not seem humanly possible.\n\nIt was the stuff of which undomesticated male fantasy is made -- the slavish gratification of a carnal desire that had previously been associated only with extramarital license. Small wonder that the 62-minute XXX-rated film, shot in six days by a Brooklyn hairdresser, went on to become astonishingly lucrative. Having been produced with what was, by porn standards, an astronomical budget of $25,000 (courtesy of Mob backers), the movie racked up at least $600 million in sales. Lovelace was paid $1,200, which she handed over to Traynor.\n\nThe history of the boudoir is a speculative one at best, but it is safe to assume that the felicities of oral sex have always been a taboo subject -- at least until Monica Lewinsky rendered it suitable for prurient but high-toned dinner table conversation. Victorian men regularly paid for the service, preferring to spare their wives the indignity of having to administer to so impure and unprocreative an urge. For most of the 20th century little changed. The English barrister and writer John Mortimer, writing shortly after Lovelace's death, recalled the 1970 obscenity trial over a novel called ''The Mouth.'' Addressing the novelist Margaret Drabble, a witness for the defense, the presiding judge asked why we needed oral sex when ''we've gone without it for a thousand years.'' This line of inquiry was picked up by the counsel for the defense in his speech to the jury: ''Poor his lordship! Poor, poor his lordship! Gone without oral sex for a thousand years!''\n\nWithout the loosening sexual mores of the late 60's and early 70's, and without the liberal elite's endorsement of the new ''porno chic,'' the success of ''Deep Throat'' would have been unthinkable. Although the film was smutty enough to rate a perfect 100 in Screw magazine, it managed within months of its release to cross over from the narrow universe of furtive blue-movie addicts into the wider sphere of solid-citizen types, some of whom took their girlfriends and wives to see it, perhaps for inspiration.\n\nAn odd assortment of people and institutions registered Lovelace's groundbreaking performance: Vice President Spiro Agnew caught her film at Frank Sinatra's house, Johnny Carson invited her on the ''Tonight'' show, Nora Ephron interviewed her for Esquire and even The New York Review of Books passed judgment, declaring the movie to be ''as erotic as a tonsillectomy.'' Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein used the title of her film as a coy moniker for their Watergate source, further imprinting it on the collective psyche.\n\nLovelace's own appeal had less to do with any extraordinary physical endowment (she was turned down for employment by Xaviera Hollander, the Happy Hooker, because her breasts were too small) than with her aura of girl-next-door availability. She became the darling of the permissive society, moving into the Playboy mansion and appearing in a see-through dress at Ascot. And over time the film's popularity helped pave the way for the mass-marketing of hard-core pornography, as well as for the mainstreaming of previously outr\u00e9 sexual practices. (''The decades since the 60's have done a remarkable job of completing the sexual revolution,'' Philip Roth observed in ''The Dying Animal.'' ''This is a generation of astonishing fellators. There's been nothing like them ever before among their class of young women.'')", "summary": "She made hard core acceptable to the masses, then crusaded against it.", "compression": 61.8571428571, "coverage": 0.7142857143, "density": 1.1428571429, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Such a time, such a place, and all these elements in a long, slow collision: the sordid glory of casino culture, the last crest of old-school Hollywood splendor, the vicious florescence of the Italian and Jewish mafias, the worldly style of the Cubans themselves and the gathering rumble of the Revolution, all playing out in a gorgeous city. Is there more in the way of material than this? A great narrative, an elegant and charismatic cast, a setting as alluring as any in the world; but we have little to show for it, in English anyway, aside from a slight Graham Greene novel and a few scenes in \u201cThe Godfather, Part II.\u201d And here is Mayra Montero, a Cuban woman now living in Puerto Rico, and \u201cDancing to \u2018Almendra,\u2019 \u201d her ninth novel, lovingly translated by Edith Grossman: a flawless little book with a deceptively light touch, that covers exactly those years.\n\nMontero\u2019s novel is narrated by a man named Joaqu\u00edn Porrata, a 22-year-old reporter living in Havana during the last days of Batista, who shows up for work one morning and finds he\u2019s been assigned the story of a hippopotamus that has escaped from the zoo and been shot to death. As it happens, that same night the mafia capo Umberto Anastasia was murdered in a hotel barber\u2019s shop in New York City, and from a rather strange little zookeeper named Juan Bulgado (or Johnny Angel, or Johnny Lamb: in Havana even a zookeeper can dream), Porrata discovers that the two killings are related. Rebuffed by his boss, who wants to keep him on the entertainment beat, he takes his notes to a rival paper, which sends him first through the Cuban underworld, then to New York and then to the upstate town of Apalachin, where a mob summit has been interrupted by the police, though not quickly enough to spare Anastasia a death sentence from his peers. Along the way Porrata encounters a woman named Yolanda, a small-town refugee who ran away with the circus, where she lost her arm serving as the model in a magician\u2019s sword-through-a-box trick. She\u2019s rumored to have a lover of her own, Santo Trafficante \u2014 himself a Mafia boss and a very scary man. Nevertheless Porrata pursues her as he pursues the story, and winds up getting them both, though not without being roughed up a few times along the way. In fact, between the animals in the zoo and the mobsters running the casinos, the book gets very bloody.\n\nThe Apalachin meeting and the death of Anastasia are real events in the history of organized crime, the hippopotamus I don\u2019t know about, but Porrata\u2019s character is presumably invented: that noise you hear is the sound of fact and fiction rubbing together, and they make a remarkable music. Montero has been a newspaper reporter herself, and she brings to the story a reporter\u2019s emphasis on narrative momentum and easy detail, while leaving behind a reporter\u2019s reliance on boilerplate and clich\u00e9. Her writing is swift and agile; it dances like a tough kid in a good suit \u2014 well pressed but never boring, and never calling attention to the strength that lies behind it. Not a single sentence in the book stands out as being special or quotable, but none seem flat, either; they roll past you without ever knocking you over, and if you think that\u2019s an easy feat to pull off, I\u2019d ask you to reconsider. It isn\u2019t often done.\n\nAnd then the book divides and gets more interesting still. Yolanda starts telling her own story, in chapters interspersed with Porrata\u2019s, and where his voice is full of callow bravado, hers is more romantic, musical and melancholy, though if anything it\u2019s even more controlled. Her paragraphs murmur on for pages without a break, at times she drops conjunctions and slips into comma-splices, she\u2019s confessing and she can\u2019t stop herself. This, too, is a virtuosic turn, the more impressive for its understatement: it takes a perfect sense of pace, such that one event follows rhythmically upon the last, and the passing of time and its consequences fall neatly into sentences, without remainder or recourse to any larger structuring device. If it\u2019s handled gracefully, as it is in \u201cDancing to \u2018Almendra,\u2019 \u201d you scarcely notice it: the book canters along, confident in the pure pleasure of its own momentum, and before you know it you\u2019ve covered more ground than you would have thought possible. The nearest comparison I can think of, though it jumps back a few centuries and across the border between languages, is to some of the short stories of Heinrich von Kleist.\n\nThe long italicized sections of Yolanda\u2019s story describe in some detail her youth, her carny life, the loss of her arm and her affair with Roderico, a leprous bisexual choreographer at the Tropicana. In paraphrase, it sounds like heavy weather, but in the book itself, leavened as it is with Porrata\u2019s more boisterous story, and with the undeniably appealing backdrop of crime, revolution and money, it feels anything but forced. There\u2019s a certain polysexuality at work here (Porrata\u2019s sister, a fondly drawn but marginal figure, is a distinctly mannish teenage lesbian), an underlying rankness and humidity. Much of the book is summoned out of episodes of sensation: meals eaten, beds slept in, city lights and the smell of tobacco and perfume. The danzon for which the book is named appears and then vanishes again, as do several black-and-white movies, the injections of gold that Roderico takes to cure his disease and (the name itself is like an incantation) Idlewild airport. But Montero doesn\u2019t lose sight of the story for a second. The book skips back and forth, between Porrata\u2019s tale and Yolanda\u2019s, between Cuba and New York, between a hard-boiled gangster story and a slightly Gothic love story, until in time they seem to merge into one voice, irrefutable but split between two characters, with two different histories and two different fates. It rises a little, and then emerges, suddenly and startlingly, out into the full sunlight of historical fact, as Porrata finds himself facing appointments with a pair of super-real characters: George Raft, who\u2019s down in Havana in his capacity as part-owner and shill for the Capri hotel and casino, and Meyer Lansky, who, in that time and place, is God.\n\nFor myself, I am tired of gangster stories and wary of grotesques, impatient with impatient writing and uninterested in realism of any kind \u2014 not this novel\u2019s obvious audience, but I devoured it with absolute delight, and I\u2019m looking forward to reading it again, and to reading anything Montero might come up with next. It\u2019s tempting to think in categories \u2014 it\u2019s tempting to me, anyway: so sue me \u2014 but a good novel denies them, nimbly and without visible effort. This novel is great fun to read, and a paradoxical thing to contemplate. When I was done, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was an especially well-written genre story, or a literary book based upon an especially raffish plot. Perhaps there\u2019s no difference between the two, after all.\n\nJim Lewis\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cThe King Is Dead.\u201d He lives in Austin, Tex.", "summary": "In Mayra Montero\u2019s novel, set in the late 50s in Cuba, a reporter follows a lead connecting the murders of a hippopotamus and a mafia capo.", "compression": 48.5, "coverage": 0.9, "density": 1.9, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false, "comment": "Title is useless."}

There were 20,000 government workers laid off last month, by far the largest drop for any sector of the economy, mostly from states, counties and cities.\n\nThat continues a troubling trend that\u2019s been building for years, one that has had a particularly harsh effect on black workers. While the private sector has been adding jobs since the end of 2009, more than half a million government positions have been lost since the recession.\n\nIn most cases, states and cities had to lay off workers because of declining tax revenues, or reduced federal aid because of Washington\u2019s inexplicable decision to focus more on the deficit in the near term than on jobs.\n\nThose layoffs mean a lower quality of life when there are fewer teachers, pothole repair crews and nurses. On Thursday, a deteriorating budget situation prompted what officials in Marion, Ind., called a \u201cradical reorganization\u201d of city services, which will result in the layoffs of 15 police officers (out of 58) and 12 firefighters (out of 50).\n\nThe cutbacks hurt more than just services. As Timothy Williams of The Times reported last week, they hit black workers particularly hard. Millions of African-Americans \u2014 one in five who are employed \u2014 have entered the middle class through government employment, and they tend to make 25 percent more than other black workers. Now tens of thousands are leaving both their jobs and the middle class. Chicago, for example, is laying off 212 employees in the upcoming fiscal year, two-thirds of whom are black.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason the black unemployment rate went up last month, to 15.5 percent from 15.1. The effect is severe, destabilizing black neighborhoods and making it harder for young people to replicate their parents\u2019 climb up the economic ladder. \u201cThe reliance on these jobs has provided African-Americans a path upward,\u201d said Robert Zieger, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Florida. \u201cBut it is also a vulnerability.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans, however, don\u2019t regard government jobs as actual jobs, and are eager to see them disappear. Republican governors around the Midwest have aggressively tried to break the power of public unions while slashing their work forces, and Congressional Republicans have proposed paying for a payroll tax cut by reducing federal employment rolls by 10 percent through attrition. That\u2019s 200,000 jobs, many of which would be filled by blacks and Hispanics and others who tend to vote Democratic, and thus are considered politically superfluous.\n\nBut every layoff, whether public or private, is a life, and a livelihood, and a family.

In the course of the book he will not only cheat on five wives and innumerable girlfriends and send an innocent man to jail, but he will also steal another scientist\u2019s plans for stopping global warming and try to turn them into a big, moneymaking machine. This self-deluding scientist will come to embody just about everything that has brought about the climate-change crisis in the first place: greed, heedlessness and a willful refusal to think about consequences or the future.\n\nDespite the book\u2019s somber, scientific backdrop (and global warming here is little but that), \u201cSolar\u201d is Mr. McEwan\u2019s funniest novel yet \u0097 a novel that in tone and affect often reads more like something by Zo\u00eb Heller or David Lodge. Like \u201cAmsterdam,\u201d this latest book shows off his gifts as a satirist, but while it gets off to a rollicking start, its plot machinery soon starts to run out of gas, sputtering and stalling as it makes its way from one comic set piece to another.\n\nWhereas Mr. McEwan created a wonderfully symphonic narrative in his 2002 masterpiece, \u201cAtonement,\u201d he has chosen here to lock readers into Beard\u2019s point of view (even though the story is recounted in the third person). It\u2019s a claustrophobic place to be, as we find ourselves trapped inside Beard\u2019s filthy London flat and, worse, inside his piggy mind, which is constantly manufacturing rationalizations for his increasingly outrageous behavior.\n\nBeard, we learn, won his Nobel for work he did a long time ago, and since then he\u2019s coasted on his reputation, giving lectures and speeches and attending conferences and symposiums. He hasn\u2019t done any serious work in two decades, having instead expended his energies on his hectic love life: dozens of affairs and five marriages, none of which, to his relief, have resulted in a child. Beard thinks nothing of his own cheating, but is outraged when he learns that his current wife, the beauteous Patrice, is seeing a thuggish contractor named Rodney Tarpin.\n\nPatrice, it turns out, has another lover as well: Tom Aldous, a young physicist at the government research center where Beard works. An earnest, friendly lad, Aldous is worried about global warming and wants to work on solar energy \u0097 particularly artificial photosynthesis \u0097 and he tries to get the cynical and misanthropic Beard to share his concern.\n\nOne day Beard returns home from a trip to find Aldous sprawled on his sofa in a dressing gown. Though Aldous admits to an affair with Patrice, he tries to persuade Beard to be sensible about the whole situation, arguing that they should put aside the pettiness of romantic rivalry in the interests of science \u0097 that they should actually become partners in the search for a renewable source of energy. Then, in one of those random, life-changing events that animate so many McEwan novels, Aldous slips on the polar bear rug in the sitting room, hits his head on the edge of a glass table and is suddenly lying there dead.\n\nInstead of doing the rational thing \u0097 and, as a scientist, Beard considers himself a rationalist above all \u0097 and calling the police, Beard rearranges things in the room to make it look as if Aldous had been murdered. Murdered, that is, by Patrice\u2019s other lover, Tarpin.\n\nAll of this is quite suspenseful, but Mr. McEwan, curiously, does not make much of the police investigation, Beard\u2019s worries about being caught, Tarpin\u2019s trial or Patrice\u2019s reaction. Instead he quickly whisks Tarpin off to jail, and leaps five years ahead to 2005, when we find Beard busy setting up a business that will supposedly make electricity out of sunlight.\n\nThis breakthrough technology is based on the work of Tom Aldous, though Beard of course does not give the young man credit; he wants the world to think that he, Michael Beard, Nobel Prize winner, has ridden to the rescue of a world on the brink of global-warming disaster. The third section of the novel takes place in 2009, when Beard is preparing the debut of his photosynthesis plant in the New Mexico desert.\n\nWhile recounting Beard\u2019s story, Mr. McEwan gives the reader some uproarious moments, like a sequence in which Beard makes some politically incorrect remarks about women and becomes the subject of a media feeding frenzy, somewhat reminiscent of the 2005 imbroglio involving Lawrence H.

Clement, who represents the 26 states challenging the law, was not just the length of the arguments that the court will hear, but the variety of topics to be addressed.\n\nThe law itself is a sprawling revision of the health care system meant to provide coverage to tens of millions of previously uninsured Americans by imposing new requirements on states, employers and insurance companies and, through what has been called the individual mandate, requiring most Americans to obtain insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe decision in the case will have enormous practical consequences for how health care is delivered in the United States. It is likely to land in June, with large repercussions for both President Obama and his Republican challenger just before the two parties hold their nominating conventions.\n\nThe justices have broken the case into four discrete issues, scheduling a separate session for each, for a total of six hours, the most in more than 40 years. Mr. Clement, like his principal adversary, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., will be arguing three times.\n\nWalter Dellinger, who was acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said he was worried about \u201cthe enormous endurance challenge this will be for Verrilli and Clement.\u201d Mr. Dellinger, who has argued more than 20 cases in the Supreme Court, said making even a single 30-minute presentation is draining.\n\n\u201cThe day or two after a Supreme Court argument I just basically collapse,\u201d he said.\n\nThe central issue in the case, to be argued for two hours on Tuesday, is whether the individual mandate is constitutional.\n\nBut first, on Monday, the justices will hear 90 minutes of arguments from three lawyers about whether they should be hearing the case at all.\n\nAn 1867 federal law, the Anti-Injunction Act, bars suits \u201cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., and a prominent federal appeals court judge in Washington have issued opinions saying that the 1867 law means a decision in the health care case must be deferred until 2015, when Americans will first be penalized if they do not have health insurance..\n\nBut neither the Obama administration nor the parties challenging the law agree with that ruling. So the court appointed a Washington lawyer, Robert A. Long, to speak on behalf of that argument. The court makes such appointments every year or so, and the practice has been the subject of some skeptical academic commentary.\n\nThe Obama administration initially agreed that the court could not rule on challenges to the law for a few more years, but it reversed course in the appeals courts. It has since relinquished other opportunities to slow down the case and insists it wants a prompt decision.\n\nMr. Long was one of three lawyers who presented mock arguments in the grand ceremonial courtroom at the Supreme Court Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center. The moot court program there also helped prepare Mr. Clement, twice, as well as Michael A. Carvin, who represents private challengers to the law.\n\nMr. Clement and Mr. Carvin will face Mr. Verrilli on Tuesday for the main event, the argument over whether the requirement to obtain insurance was authorized by the Constitution as a regulation of interstate commerce or by the power to levy taxes. The administration says the health care law is well within the powers granted by the Constitution, while the challengers say it plainly exceeds what the federal government may do.\n\nFor Wednesday, the court has scheduled a double feature.\n\nIn the morning, the justices will hear 90 minutes of arguments about what should happen if they strike down the mandate. The federal appeals court in Atlanta, whose decision is under review, ruled that it was possible to remove just the mandate and leave the balance of the law intact.\n\nAs with the 1867 law, neither side agrees with that ruling. So here, too, the court has appointed an outside lawyer, H. Bartow Farr III, to argue the point.\n\nMr. Clement will contend that the entire law must fall. A colleague of Mr. Verrilli\u2019s in the solicitor general\u2019s office, Edwin S. Kneedler, will argue for a middle ground, saying that most of the law should stand but that two other provisions \u2014 one forbidding insurers to turn away applicants, the other barring them from taking account of pre-existing conditions \u2014 are intertwined with the mandate and would have to fall along with it.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the two main lawyers, Mr. Verrilli and Mr. Clement, will return for an encore, this time to argue over whether Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in expanding the eligibility and coverage thresholds that states must adopt to remain eligible to participate in Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care to poor and disabled people.\n\nThere is room for only about 400 people in the courtroom, and prominent lawyers and politicians have been scrambling for tickets. The court has set aside about 60 seats for members of the public, and the line for them, including placeholders paid by the hour, started forming on Friday morning. When he started thinking about how to prepare, Mr. Clement said, \u201cYou had to make a decision about whether this is one argument or three arguments.\u201d He decided that it was three, largely because the justices seemed to think so.\n\nMr. Clement, who has argued more than 50 times in the Supreme Court, said he usually scheduled two moot courts per argument. Here, he said, he settled for five sessions for three arguments, one on every weekday last week \u2014 two at Georgetown, two at the National Association of Attorneys General and one at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLawyers in the solicitor general\u2019s office also hold moot courts, though in a less grand setting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the lunchroom, basically,\u201d said Neal K. Katyal, who was the acting solicitor general until last summer and who defended the health care law in federal appeals courts. \u201cThere is probably not a room in Washington that looks less like the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThere are two main points to the exercise, said Gregory G. Katsas, who will argue on Monday on behalf of the challengers that the court should not wait until 2015 to rule.\n\n\u201cOne is identifying difficult and likely questions,\u201d he said, \u201cand the other is just practicing articulating the answers in the stress of something that approximates being at the podium.\u201d\n\nMr. Clement said he valued the ideological diversity among the fake justices who questioned him last week.\n\n\u201cSome of the most helpful questions I\u2019ve gotten were from people I\u2019d guess are rooting against me,\u201d he said. \u201cMost helpful,\u201d he explained, meant \u201cthe most thought-provoking, most difficult, most challenging.\u201d\n\nIrving L. Gornstein, the executive director of the Georgetown program, which holds moot courts in the vast majority of Supreme Court cases, said the sessions were helpful not only for the advocates but also for students, who are allowed to attend if they promise to keep what they see and hear confidential.\n\nSupreme Court advocates can be obsessive, and many say there is no such thing as too much preparation. Mr. Katyal said he used to download recordings of his moot courts to his iPod.\n\n\u201cI would jog in the morning,\u201d Mr. Katyal recalled, \u201cand listen to my moots and listen to how I sounded.\u201d", "summary": "Practice sessions for the lawyers debating President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care law in Supreme Court arguments this week have stretched the supply of colleagues willing to play the justices.", "compression": 50.8965517241, "coverage": 0.8275862069, "density": 1.5172413793, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Inside, the booths are puritanical, with stiff backs of dark stained wood, overlooked by mirrors and crimson wallpaper in a study of drifting leaves.\n\nThe look suggests a modern cha chaan teng, the kind of old-school Hong Kong coffee shop celebrated in the film \u201cIn the Mood for Love,\u201d which Maggie Cheung haunts in a cheongsam with swirled-up hair, slinky and demure at once. And while the menu here is loftier than a cha chaan teng\u2019s roster of Western-ish Chinese comfort food, it too looks from East to West in surprising ways.\n\nIn lieu of Chinese red jujubes, there are plump Medjool dates, steeped in soy, star anise and bark cinnamon, smoked over applewood and filled with duck confit, then buttermilk-battered and deep-fried. The layers astound: first salty crunch, then sweet chew, and finally the yielding center of succulent duck, still ticking with heat.\n\nShrimp paste, served with dainty leaves of Shanghai bok choy, is made with shrimp rubbed with Old Bay spices, as if at a crab boil, and steamed rather than fermented. It still throws a punch, the shrimp\u2019s brininess underscored by tomato paste and the Chinese threesome of ginger, garlic and scallions.\n\nNubs of beef jerky, from Jung\u2019s on Mulberry Street, are tossed with dill sprigs, dill pollen and peanuts fried in oxtail fat. How is it that this dish never existed before? It is less food than compulsion, bright, grassy and carnal, and entirely plausible as an entrant in the Chinese canon.\n\nThe Bronx-born chef, Jonathan Wu, cooked at Per Se, a training that shows in the delicacy and technical intricacy of many of his dishes, like whorls of thin beet slices ornamented with gray-green thousand-year-old egg and dehydrated shards of twice-fermented bean curd, or a pur\u00e9e of broad beans set with kuzu flour and shaped into a terrine with a secret inner layer of minced bacon and pickled mustard greens.\n\nFung Tu, which opened in November, is run by Mr. Wu, John Matthew Wells, Jason Wagner and Wilson Tang, who a few years ago revitalized the Chinatown dim-sum institution Nom Wah Tea Parlor. Mr. Wu makes his own version of the Nom Wah egg roll, packing it with pork belly, leeks, pickled Thai bird chiles and \u2014 genius! \u2014 olives, which keep it moist and give it a briny shiver.\n\nMr. Wu isn\u2019t quite as freewheeling as Danny Bowien, whose hysterically popular Mission Chinese Food operated just a few blocks north of Fung Tu until recently. Mr. Wu\u2019s dishes are quieter and more scholarly, which means that sometimes they aren\u2019t as immediate in their pleasures.\n\nIt is hard to know what to make of silky tofu bathed in fish stock, which tastes mostly of the seaweed heaped on top, or soybean curd dumplings molded like gnudi and presented in a celery-mushroom consomm\u00e9 so subtle I couldn\u2019t pinpoint any flavor at all. Celtuce, a kind of lettuce with a long, tubby stalk, is wilted with popcorn pur\u00e9e and topped with a soy-blackened egg, neither of which can rouse the vegetable from slumber.\n\nAt times, classics are reinvented to no discernible improvement, like a Chinese breakfast crepe turned into an Indian dosa or steamed bao buns done in the style of Parker House rolls, with malt powder in the dough and a wash of butter. A scallion pancake made with Mexican masa, in homage to a huarache, is a downgrade, an unwieldy slab without the original\u2019s lightness or verve.\n\nEntrees are more straightforward: a deep-fried pork chop; soybean sprouts and bacon stir-fried with black vinegar and heaped over rice, saline and comforting. Dumpling knots, or mian geda (best understood as a Chinese spaetzle), are thrillingly overrun by a Sichuan pork sauce akin to that in mapo tofu, which manages to be somehow brash and refined.\n\nFung Tu is at its best when it traffics in nostalgia. The duck-stuffed dates are Mr. Wu\u2019s attempt to recreate a long-lost street snack from pre-revolutionary Shanghai that his relatives still sigh over; a dessert of silken tofu harks back to a Mott Street shop where tofu was scooped like ice cream and doused with rock sugar syrup. And those chocolate-peanut-butter balls studded with sesame seeds? They\u2019re a salute to Mr. Wu\u2019s father\u2019s favorite candy: Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.\n\n22 Orchard Street (Hester Street), 212-219-8785, fungtu.com\n\nRECOMMENDED Bok choy with shrimp paste; duck-stuffed dates; peanuts, dill and beef jerky; beets; broad bean curd terrine; original egg roll version 2; dumpling knots with Sichuan pork sauce; sunchokes with shrimp paste.\n\nOPEN Tuesday to Sunday for dinner.\n\nWHEELCHAIR ACCESS The entrance is level with the sidewalk.

Frey, a demographer at Brookings. That was up from six states in 2000.\n\n\u201cWe are on our way to having a majority of minority students in U.S. schools,\u201d Mr. Frey said.\n\nNationally, whites accounted for 58.8 percent of all school enrollment in 2009, Mr. Frey said, citing the new data, which measured enrollment from preschool to graduate school as of October 2009. That was down from 64.6 percent in 2000, a decline that came with falling birthrates as the white population aged.\n\nPopulation growth has come instead from Hispanics, blacks and Asians, whose children represent ever larger shares of the school population. Twenty-three percent of children in kindergarten were Hispanic in 2009, up from 18 percent in 2000 and 10 percent in 1989. Hispanics now account for nearly a fifth of all enrollment from nursery school through college, Mr. Frey said.\n\nThe United States has been experiencing the biggest surge of immigrants since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when European immigrants considerably expanded the population.\n\nAnd while immigrants have long taken to cities, more recently they have spread throughout the nation, creating diverse student populations in places that had been overwhelmingly white.\n\nThe states whose white children dipped to below 50 percent of nursery school and kindergarten enrollment most recently were Arizona, Florida and Nevada, Mr. Frey said. Next in line are Georgia, Louisiana and Maryland, he said.\n\nThe gap between the country\u2019s diverse young population and its older white one is raising difficult issues for policy makers, who are trying to balance the growing costs associated with the aging white population with the need for financing to educate an increasingly diverse youth.\n\nEducation experts who have studied the issue say the United States is lagging behind in educating minority students. The past big wave of immigrants took more than a generation to integrate into the economy through education, they say, a delay the country can ill afford in today\u2019s age of global competitiveness.\n\n\u201cThese students will be an important source of our labor-force growth as baby boomers begin retiring,\u201d Mr. Frey said.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on February 8, 2011, on page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Among Nation\u2019s Youngest, Analysis Finds Fewer Whites.

Buying Rite Aid would give it an additional 4,600 stores in 31 states, adding to its roughly 8,200 locations across the country, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe biggest drugstore chain, CVS Health, has also grown, acquiring Long\u2019s Drug, Medicine Chest and Navarro Discount Pharmacy, and now runs more than 7,800 stores.\n\nWith years of steep losses, Rite Aid, which itself acquired the Brooks and Eckerd pharmacy chains in 2007, has fallen to a distant third.\n\n\u201cThe pharmacy consolidation endgame has begun,\u201d said Adam J.

But this filmmaker \u2014 who won an Oscar for \u201cForrest Gump\u201d (1994) and is responsible for enduring favorites like \u201cBack to the Future\u201d (1985) and \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d (1988) \u2014 has not been off riding with the Valkyries.\n\nInstead Mr. Zemeckis has spent the last decade conducting some very public experiments with new digital technologies. Over the course of three animated features \u2014 \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d (2004), \u201cBeowulf\u201d (2007) and \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d (2009) \u2014 he has set out to explore the new century\u2019s alliance of computing and filmmaking, and in the process has done a great deal to push that relationship along.\n\nHis reluctance to advertise himself as an auteur may account for the sense of surprise that has greeted his new film. Few members, if any, of the Internet\u2019s legions of Oscarologists had \u201cFlight\u201d on their radar for the coming award season, but the film\u2019s strong reception at its festival screening is most likely to force some recalibration.\n\nAt 61 Mr. Zemeckis is a soft-spoken, solidly built man whose hard consonants contain faint traces of his upbringing in a working-class neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. In conversation he often seems hesitant to discuss his work in terms of themes and structure, but he dives into the details of craft and technique with enthusiasm.\n\nHis determination to bring the softly naturalistic, fully dimensional look of Chris Van Allsburg\u2019s illustrations for the beloved children\u2019s book \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d to the screen led him to investigate the emerging field of motion-capture technology. The process, known as mo-cap, uses scanners rather than cameras to track the movements of performers and convert them into three-dimensional models, bypassing traditional forms of animation. In effect the technology transforms a human actor into a data field that the filmmaker can manipulate to his heart\u2019s content. In the completed film Tom Hanks was able to portray six characters, from a train conductor to a rather sinister Santa Claus.\n\nMr. Zemeckis also discovered that the resulting digital imagery could be rendered as a 3-D film by converting the data into left-eye and right-eye perspectives, a process that made \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d the first feature-length hit for Imax 3-D.\n\nIn its early days the mo-cap process wasn\u2019t perfect. Some reviewers complained about the \u201cdead eyes\u201d of the characters in \u201cThe Polar Express,\u201d or of a vague sense of coldness and creepiness. As Mr. Zemeckis acknowledges today he may have been pushing the envelope a little too hard. \u201cThe computers weren\u2019t fast enough,\u201d he said, during a public \u201cDirectors Dialogue\u201d session at the New York Film Festival.\n\nAnd while all three motion-capture films made money, the mere fact that they were animated meant, to many reviewers, that Mr. Zemeckis had abandoned his prestigious position in Hollywood to spend \u201c12 years mucking about in the motion-capture playpen,\u201d as Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter recently wrote.\n\nAnd yet Mr. Zemeckis changed the game. It is difficult to imagine the mo-cap-dominated 3-D blockbusters of the last several years \u2014 films like James Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d or Joss Whedon\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d \u2014 without the innovations that Mr. Zemeckis and his collaborators nursed along through those three movies.\n\nWith \u201cFlight,\u201d Mr. McCarthy wrote, \u201cRobert Zemeckis parachutes back to where he belongs, in big-time, big-star, live-action filmmaking.\u201d\n\nMr. Zemeckis, though, sees no break with his standard practice, which is to use state-of-the-art technology in the service of classic cinematic storytelling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same,\u201d he said of \u201cFlight,\u201d which opens nationally Friday. Short of 3-D, the movie makes use of the full spectrum of digital techniques that have emerged in the last decade, from three-dimensional, digital storyboarding in the preproduction phase to the touching up of details in postproduction.

My neighborhood is in Pantin, where the infamous northeastern suburbs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the banlieues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 begin. When I told one Parisian where I lived during casual chatter at a dinner party in the chic Marais quarter, he actually stepped away from me and blurted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuelle horreur!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a horrible place. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where, for better or worse, a new France is being forged.\n\nOn the noisy sidewalks of the boulevard near my apartment, there are no Hemingway-besotted expats in search of their own \u00e2\u0080\u009cMidnight in Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u009d My local farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 market does not sell kale, the latest trendy American import, and the bakery on the corner features round flat loaves of sesame-studded bread for a largely North African clientele.\n\nMy neighbors come from around the world; legal or illegal immigrants from Africa, South Asia, China and Vietnam. Most of the white faces I see are Poles, Ukrainians, Russians and Serbs. While I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy a good baguette, expertly cut meat from \u00e2\u0080\u009cknown parentage\u00e2\u0080\u009d or high-quality aged French cheeses right outside my door, I can get preserved lemons, bulk-priced spices, basmati rice and the most amazing lemongrass-infused Thai sausages I have ever tasted.\n\nI travel mostly by metro, shuttling back and forth between my home and Paname, as Paris is known here in the suburbs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an old nickname taken from the Panama hats worn by 19th-century fashionistas. I ride the No. 5, which runs north-south and stops at the Gare du Nord, at once the transit point for the Eurostar to London and the gateway to the graffiti-scrawled suburban trains that ferry black and brown residents of the far-flung suburbs in and out of Paris. When I ride home in the evening, many of the whites get off at R\u00c3\u00a9publique, the heart of Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly hip eastern quarters. I find myself then in a car where many languages are spoken, rarely French, and where one never hears the twangy tones of excited American tourists.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned a lot during my long commutes on the metro. One thing is not to underestimate the cosmopolitanism of my fellow travelers. I found myself sitting once next to a young French-African woman. I was stunned when her phone rang and she answered in serviceable Hindi. When she finished, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help asking her how it was that she spoke the language. Oh, she explained, she belonged to an evangelical church and had learned Hindi, in Paris, to spread the good word among Indian immigrants. I knew evangelical Protestantism was flourishing in immigrant communities in France, but this cross-cultural example floored me.\n\nWhen I emerge from the storied metro stations of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00c3\u00a9s, Louvre or Saint-Paul, I am always blown away by the beauty of old Paris, with its limestone buildings, its grand boulevards and its elegant cafes where a gar\u00c3\u00a7on with a starched white tea towel over his arm will call you Madame. I try not to see the Starbucks and the McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that have invaded this capital of fine dining, and I often buy a loaf of good bread and some very expensive cheese to carry home.\n\nSome day soon, I may not have to travel into Paris to buy these things. My neighborhood is changing. The canal that snakes up from the Seine in eastern Paris has long been gentrified up to the Parc de la Villette, a modern swath of green on Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northern border. Work is in full swing to rehabilitate the seedy banks of the canal beyond. The old mills in Pantin have been transformed into offices for the banking giant BNP. Further north, Chanel has installed its headquarters. Herm\u00c3\u00a8s has bought up whole blocks for its ateliers. New apartment buildings are going up with spaces reserved for affordable housing but also for canalside cafes. Just down the road from the Tang Fr\u00c3\u00a8res Chinese supermarket, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac has opened a new space in an old warehouse where members of the international art scene view works by Anselm Kiefer and Joseph Beuys.\n\nFrom every side of my apartment, I see cranes. Construction is booming. The new tramway that will one day circle all around Paris stops downstairs. In a nod to gender balance, many of the new tram stops are named after women. My stop is Delphine Seyrig. The next stop is Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nPantin is proud of its working-class heritage. It is home to a green school, which produces more energy than it consumes. It hosts a collective that delivers local produce by barge several times a week along the canal. It sponsors a jazz festival and a film festival. It is building a new market square, repaving streets and cleaning up its parks. The neighborhood is not immune to signs of the widening gap between the ideals of the secular French social-welfare state and an increasingly diverse population. Small Muslim girls wearing head scarves trail behind their fully covered mothers. Young black men with nothing better to do smoke in front of the public housing entrance. An illegal immigrant from Pakistan sells fruit from a crate on the sidewalk. But there are also boisterous girls in skinny jeans, tousled hair tangling in the wind, a girl from Algeria arm-in-arm with one from Senegal.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel despair or fear here, but something more alive than the static elegance of eternal Paris.

The number of women with a baby but no partner was too small to draw statistically significant conclusions.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that having a partner causes metabolic changes, so the weight gain among childless women with partners was almost surely caused by altered behavior. Moreover, there was a steady weight gain among all women over the 10 years of the study.\n\nThis does not explain the still larger weight gain in women who became pregnant. The lead author, Annette J. Dobson, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Queensland in Australia, suggested that physiological changes might be at work.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s bodies may adjust to the increased weight associated with having a baby,\u201d Dr. Dobson said. \u201cThere may be a metabolic adjustment that goes on when women are pregnant that is hard to reverse. This would be more consistent with our findings than any other explanation.\u201d\n\nThe study covered more than 6,000 Australian women over a 10-year period ending in 2006.\n\nAt the start, the women ranged in age from 18 to 23. Each woman periodically completed a survey with more than 300 questions about weight and height, age, level of education, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, medications used and a wide range of other health and health care issues.\n\nBy the end of the study, published in the January issue of The American Journal of Preventive Medicine, more than half the women had college degrees, about three-quarters had partners and half had had at least one baby. Almost all of the weight gain happened with the first baby; subsequent births had little effect.\n\nAlso by the end of the study period, there were fewer smokers and risky drinkers than at the beginning, more women who exercised less and a larger proportion without paid employment.\n\nBut even after adjusting for all of these factors and more, the differences in weight gain among women with and without babies, and among women with and without partners, remained.\n\nDespite the study\u2019s limitations \u0097 weight was self-reported, for example, and the sample size diminished over time because people dropped out \u0097 other experts found the results valuable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting and brings out some important points,\u201d said Maureen A. Murtaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Utah who has published widely on weight gain in women. Perhaps, she suggested, a more active social life may help explain why women with partners gain more weight.\n\n\u201cThink of going to a restaurant,\u201d Dr. Murtaugh said. \u201cThey serve a 6-foot man the same amount as they serve me, even though I\u2019m 5 feet 5 inches and 60 pounds lighter.\u201d\n\nThe study included only women, but the researchers cited one earlier study that showed an increase in obesity among men who had children, adding further evidence that social and behavioral factors are part of the explanation.\n\nDr. Dobson said the finding of weight gain among all the women, with families or without, was troubling.\n\n\u201cThis is a general health concern,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting married or moving in with a partner and having a baby are events that trigger even further weight gain.\n\n\u201cFrom a prevention point of view, one can look at these as particular times when women need to be especially careful.\u201d", "summary": "A large Australian survey found evidence that even among childless women, those who lived with a mate put on more pounds than those who lived without one.", "compression": 25.724137931, "coverage": 0.9310344828, "density": 7.4137931034, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Centuries later, Venetian courtesans clopped around in towering chopines, while during the reign of Louis XIV, red heels were a mark of nobility. But it was after World War II that the stiletto took hold. Soldiers who spent years abroad dreaming of high-heeled pinups, one historian wrote, came home to wives whose wartime work required more sensible shoes. As women returned to domestic life, higher heels could, and did, become all the rage. From the 1950s\u2019 froth of experimentation, the stiletto was born.\n\nDr. Emily Splichal, a podiatrist and self-styled \u00e2\u0080\u009cstiletto foot expert,\u00e2\u0080\u009d put together a stiletto-recovery-workout kit to \u00e2\u0080\u009creverse the postural stress from hours in high heels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Each kit contains the following:\n\n\u201cSome credit Ferragamo, others Roger Vivier or Perugia,\u201d says Valerie Steele, chief curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \u201cI suspect the stiletto was developed by more than one Italian shoemaker, perhaps in association with French designers.\u201d\n\nIts origins may be nebulous, but the stiletto is a precision instrument. Designers used injection molding to encase metal spigots in plastic, making ever-thinner heels safe to stand on.\n\nAs heel tips shrank to the size of tacks, the stiletto, named for an Italian shiv from the 1700s, became an emblem of the Jet Age and French haute couture. Gina Lollobrigida wore them, as did Marilyn Monroe, proud owner of 40 pairs of Ferragamo stilettos. The \u201960s counterculture rejected high heels, but in pornography the stiletto flourished. In the \u201970s, Gloria Vanderbilt wore them with designer jeans. Stylists incorporated stilettos into the power-dressing fad of the \u201980s; Madonna carried them into the \u201990s, \u201cSex and the City\u201d into the aughts. In 2008, Mike Huckabee said the only difference between him and Sarah Palin was a pair of stilettos.\n\nStilettos may shrink or grow taller, but they continue to represent both the empowered woman and the hobbled one. Stilettos make a woman \u201clook taller, thinner, more bosomy and with a curvier bottom,\u201d says Steele, but they also make it difficult for a woman to walk.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s fashion does not always emphasize the high heel,\u201d Steele wrote in an essay. \u201cShoe fetishists, however, usually have done so.\u201d\n\nPatricia Field, the costume designer for \u2018\u2018Sex and the City,\u2019\u2019 helped cement the stiletto\u2019s legacy. Here, she discusses the signature shoe.\n\nWhat is a stiletto? A stiletto is a specific style. It\u2019s a shape. It\u2019s not a height. It\u2019s a heel that looks like a Champagne glass. It could be a three-inch stiletto. Or a four-inch stiletto. It could be a two-inch stiletto. It\u2019s the shape.\n\nWhy is the stiletto so popular? It is the sexiest, most feminine shape. The shape echoes the shape of the body. When you have a column heel, it gives a different feeling. It gives a more powerful heel, but it doesn\u2019t have that feminine taper to it.\n\nWill it ever go out of style? It\u2019s like leopard, for example. It\u2019s a classic. Sometimes it becomes highly trendy, and sometimes it gets quieter, but it never goes away.\n\nDo you have a personal favorite? My most favorite pair is from Charles Jourdan; it was probably 1962. It was semi-pointy-toed, so I had toe cleavage. And it was about a four-inch stiletto. Maybe five. They cost me $80. That\u2019s like $800 today.\n\nCan anyone pull it off? Well, there are all different kinds of women, and some women can\u2019t handle a high heel, let alone a stiletto, which has the thinnest bottom. You can\u2019t ever put something on a person that they can\u2019t handle. That\u2019s the big faux pas.\n\nWhat about men? Do you think the stiletto could ever become a men\u2019s shoe? They could become popular for men when men return to dressing like Mozart.\n\nWhat are the odds of that? The way we dress over time gets much more simplified \u2014 much more utilitarian. It\u2019s the nature of the world.

Putin and other leaders denouncing the alliance as an aggressive and destabilizing force on its borders. In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry criticized Mr. Cheney\u2019s similar promises of membership in the alliance to Georgia and its president, Mikheil Saakashvili.\n\n\u201cStatements of this kind and new promises to Tbilisi of fast NATO membership only strengthen the dangerous feeling of impunity of the Saakashvili regime and encourage its aggressive ambitions,\u201d a spokesman, Andrei Nesterenko, said.\n\nRussia has blamed Mr. Saakashvili for inciting last month\u2019s brief war by trying to seize control of South Ossetia on the night of Aug. 7.\n\nThe Bush administration has vigorously lobbied the alliance to offer \u201cmembership action plans\u201d to Ukraine and Georgia and considers the alliance\u2019s expansion an important part of President Bush\u2019s \u201cfreedom agenda.\u201d The NATO allies, led by Germany and others wary of aggravating Russia, balked at that in April at the alliance\u2019s summit meeting in Bucharest, though a final statement included a promise that both countries could eventually join the alliance.\n\nWhile the United States and most European countries have uniformly denounced Russia\u2019s invasion, as well as its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, there has been no collective agreement on how strongly to respond. Even within the Bush administration, the matter is evidently still largely unsettled, though the administration has been very supportive of Georgia and Ukraine diplomatically, and has granted Georgia an aid package of $1 billion.\n\nA senior administration official traveling with Mr. Cheney said he believed that NATO would rethink its position on Georgia and Ukraine when the alliance\u2019s foreign ministers met again in December. \u201cPeople have been shaken by events in Georgia,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt has created a new situation. I think there are some indications that some of the allies are looking with a fresh set of eyes.\u201d\n\nThe official said the Bush administration would expend \u201can awful lot of energy\u201d in its remaining months in office to build support for bringing Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance.\n\nIn Avignon, France, the European Union\u2019s foreign ministers met to discuss relations with Russia and Ukraine, and signaled a less confrontational approach than the United States.\n\nAt a news conference, France\u2019s foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said that it was vital to coordinate policy with the United States but that Europe saw its relationship with Russia, a large and close neighbor, differently from the way Washington did.\n\n\u201cOf course, Mr. Cheney, the vice president, has a certain sense of protecting the people,\u201d he said when asked about Mr. Cheney\u2019s visit to Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that with this sense of protecting the people he has got a lot of success.\u201d\n\nThe European Union is to hold a summit meeting with Ukraine on Tuesday, after a senior delegation visits Moscow to try to enforce the French-brokered cease-fire agreement between Russia and Georgia. European countries are discussing how warm an embrace to give Ukraine after the Georgian fiasco.\n\nJoining NATO has been a principal policy objective of Mr. Yushchenko since he became president after public protests in 2004 that became known as the Orange Revolution. But membership is far from popular in Ukraine, where a majority of people remain hostile to the idea of splitting so sharply with Russia.\n\nDifferences over NATO and the war in Georgia contributed to political tensions here. Those issues and a new effort last week to weaken the president\u2019s powers splintered the fragile alliance between Mr. Yushchenko and Ms. Tymoshenko, raising the prospect of a new round of elections.\n\nMr. Cheney stepped carefully around Ukraine\u2019s internal political disputes, the administration official said, but in public he urged the two leaders to unite. \u201cUkraine\u2019s best hope to overcome these threats is to be united \u2014 united domestically, first and foremost, and united with other democracies,\u201d he said.\n\nA cold-war-like confrontation on the Black Sea continued Friday when the Mount Whitney, the flagship of the United States Navy\u2019s Mediterranean fleet, anchored outside the Georgian port of Poti with a delivery of tons of aid supplies.\n\nRussian troops remained stationed on the outskirts of Poti in what the Kremlin has called a security zone that stretches deep inside Georgian territory.

Yet towering apartment buildings are rising on nearly every block and rents are escalating, along with rumors. This makes it hard to tell what the future holds for galleries that don\u2019t own their spaces \u2014 which is most of them; already some have closed, others have merged or moved. And one of the anchors of the neighborhood, the commodious brick building at 548 West 22nd Street that once housed the Dia Art Foundation, and recently played host to art fairs, is now slated for development. And yet, the neighborhood can still feel like a perpetual art fair \u2014 in a good way \u2014 with galleries of all sizes and orientations sifting through past and present in exciting ways.\n\nThe pressure on galleries is reflected in Casey Kaplan\u2019s relocation inland, to West 27th Street east of Seventh Avenue. The current show at the new address is Sarah Crowner\u2019s third solo in New York \u2014 and her best yet. Working with a flexible geometric vocabulary, she produces paintings whose taut visual clarity is the result of meticulously sewing together contrasting pieces of painted or raw canvas. Ms. Crowner\u2019s shapes are usually scavenged, suggesting that reality is rife with potential abstraction. A recurring pair of arabesques echoes a design used by the artist Ray Johnson in a backdrop for a 1957 fashion shoot in Harper\u2019s Bazaar. An especially strong blue and white work magnifies a fabric pattern by the Austrian modernist Koloman Moser (1868-1918). In some new works, Ms. Crowner fragments her found shapes for greater complexity, a promising development.\n\nThis gallery moved to splendid isolation just north of Chelsea \u2014 10th Avenue, near 36th Street \u2014 three years ago when its West 29th Street space succumbed to development. The current show features the new work of Mariko Mori, best known for devising one of the first 3-D art videos, \u201cNirvana,\u201d which was seen at the 1997 Venice Biennale. Its goofy mysticism included the artist as an exquisitely turned-out, levitating goddess. Ms. Mori\u2019s latest efforts may be the dernier cri in both public plop-art sculpture and California Light and Space perceptual subtlety: M\u00f6biuslike spirals and loops of fiberglass whose pearlescent surfaces blossom with color as you move around them. They\u2019re beautiful and cheesy in about equal parts, but their weightless perfection and fleeting rainbows are something to see.\n\nPerfectly poised between abstraction and landscape, the small, cogent paintings of the Lebanese-American writer and poet Etel Adnan stood out in Documenta 13 in 2012. Her largest New York show to date includes early pastels and tapestries that have the small fluttering shapes of C\u00e9zanne; ink studies of foliage or ink pots; and a film favoring blurry sunsets. But the stars here are the paintings, all new, and the expanses of light and space released by their palette-knifed slabs of singing blues, yellows and reds. Sometimes the mountainous forms give way to more geometric arrangements. They prove that no artistic tradition is used up if you put enough of yourself in it.\n\nRoberta Smith's walk through the neighborhood.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an unequivocal fan of Joan Semmel\u2019s work to be thrilled by this small survey of five decades of explorations of paint, the body and sex. Her fearlessness is the through line, starting with two abstractions from the 1960s whose muscular forms and brusque paint-handling are reinforced by dark, radiant colors. Next come images of coupling bodies loosely painted in bright colors. But most pioneering are those images that eliminate the outside observer, portraying the artist\u2019s reclining body, alone or with a partner, from her own point of view, which also becomes ours.\n\nIn her first New York solo in five years, Jamie Isenstein continues her singular pursuit of self-effacing performance art and low-tech kinetic sculpture \u2014 mostly in the form of everyday objects animated by small flames, electric fans or the artist. Ms. Isenstein is present if invisible in (and inside) \u201cMechanical Bed,\u201d where she makes the bedcovers mysteriously bunch up, wrinkle and smoothen, suggesting disembodied slumber. In \u201cEye Books,\u201d electric fans flutter the pages of two sketchbooks filled with large watercolor images of eyes and eyelashes, as if (sort of) blinking. In two sculptures and nine photographs, Ms. Isenstein opts for a new stillness, creating a remarkable emotional animation through the layering of colorful masks.\n\nThe best works in Tom\u00e1s Saraceno\u2019s show are as much science as art. They put us on intimate terms with spider webs, perhaps the most wondrous of all animal architecture and an inspiration for Mr. Saraceno\u2019s suspended installation pieces. The webs here were built in boxy wire frames by a succession of different spiders then encased in Plexiglas. Exhibited with pinpoint lights in a darkened space, they achieve maximum visibility and reveal an astonishing variety. Some are so fine they look like clouds, while others are seemingly chaotic, fractal networks. All are engineering miracles, and one web is still under construction.\n\nThe galleries Zieher Smith and Sean Horton joined forces last year, doubling their abilities to find young or underexposed talent. The latest is Clare Grill, whose new paintings have a weblike delicacy of their own. Their almost monochromatic surfaces accrue in small free-form shapes of close shades of yellow, pink, magenta, brown or green laid on in textured brushwork. The quietly teeming surfaces bow to Paul Klee, bringing drawing\u2019s intimacy to painting\u2019s expanse. In \u201cGrain\u201d and \u201cPeacock,\u201d the shapes pull apart to reveal fluctuating shadows. Ms. Grill\u2019s control of pictorial space is precise yet magical.\n\nLike Mr. Saraceno, the Dutch artist Willem de Rooij melds art, science and nature, with craft folded in. The first things you see in the restrained spectacle of this show are four lavish bouquets in substantial vases on pedestals. You then notice the monochromatic tapestry panels on the walls; then the play of color among the flowers, the tapestries and the speckled surfaces of the vases and pedestals. Lastly you may notice that the flowers\u2019 colors recur in the variegated warps and woofs of the tapestries, which are made of common thread. These increasingly fine perceptions quietly exalt nature as the source of all human genius.\n\nAlma Thomas (1897-1978) trained as an artist, worked as a public-school teacher in Washington and, once retired, devoted the last two decades of her life to making mosaiclike abstractions in step with their time. Surveyed in 29 canvases and watercolors, her dappled fields, stripes and concentric rings of color bring an energetic bluntness and unencumbered joy to the usual refinements of Color Field and Minimalism. In February the White House website showed its refurbished Old Family Dining Room with a recently acquired Thomas hanging in pride of place \u2014 the first artwork in its collection by an African-American woman. Her place in the history of postwar painting awaits definition.\n\nChelsea galleries, though referred to in monolithic, often dismissive terms, actually run the gamut from big-box and high-powered to small and scruffy. For proof, visit the artist cooperatives that date from 1970s SoHo at 530 West 25th Street or the block-through building at 547 West 27th Street, a kind of S.R.O. for galleries. One incentive for such a visit is Montserrat\u2019s show of the little-known subway scenes made in the \u201970s by Richard E. Brooks, a cinematographer and self-taught painter. They depict lonely men in dark stations or, more strikingly, in the green train cars of the era, jazzed up by the classic wicker seats and inexplicable gleaming white floors and ceilings. The best merge the urban Surrealism of George Tooker with the darker, more robust renderings of Horace Pippin. (Through Saturday.)\n\nTen minireviews can\u2019t do justice to Chelsea\u2019s art offerings. MITCHELL-INNES & NASH has a museum-quality, nearly comprehensive show of Joseph Beuys\u2019s multiples (at 534 West 26th Street, through Saturday). At JACK SHAINMAN Hank Willis Thomas\u2019s archival tour de force, titled \u201cUnbranded: A Century of White Women, 1915-2015,\u201d presents 100 carefully culled print ads that trace the halting progress of feminism and \u2014 by omitting nonwhite women \u2014 the even more dispiriting state of racial equality in this country (513 West 20th Street, through May 23). And in a seductive duo show called \u201cOuter Loop\u201d at MARLBOROUGH CHELSEA, Tony Cox\u2019s embroidered paintings and Matthew Ronay\u2019s painted-wood sculptures parlay color, craft and several Asian precedents into some of each artist\u2019s best work yet (545 West 25th Street, through May 9). Beyond this, you\u2019re on your own.\n\nPORCHLIGHT It\u2019s a bit of a hike to get there, but once you do the reception is friendly at this spacious new Danny Meyer bar.

After six years of near silence on the issues, President Bush this year has endorsed stringent new mileage rules, a sharp increase in production of renewable fuels and concerted international action on climate change.\n\nFor years, efforts in Congress to impose strict fuel economy rules were stymied by a coalition of pro-business Republicans and auto-state Democrats unwilling to dictate to the Big Three carmakers. More recently, broad legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been stalled by opposition from electric utilities, coal producers, oil refiners and factory owners afraid of the costs of compliance.\n\n\u201cAll that has changed,\u201d said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been a frustrated advocate for automobile fuel efficiency and energy conservation legislation in his 15 terms in Congress. \u201cThings are now dramatically and in a telescoped time frame all coming together to address these issues that have been on a 30-year detour.\u201d\n\nOn a less cosmic scale, a change in the domestic political climate has been critical, too. When Democrats took control of the House and the Senate in January, they declared that energy legislation would be a top priority and set this month as an informal deadline for action.\n\nRepresentative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the senior member of the House and a longtime advocate for the auto industry, concluded this year that some form of fuel economy bill was coming. He warned top auto executives that he would do his best to protect the industry from unworkable measures but that they should begin to retool for a new, fuel-constrained era.\n\nMr. Dingell waged a valiant fight with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on behalf of the auto industry last week and won important concessions. But the 35-m.p.g.-by-2020 standard stayed in the bill and is expected to become law.\n\n\u201cFor almost 20 years, automakers and environmentalists have been locked into an often-vitriolic and rarely productive fight over fuel economy,\u201d said Jason Grumet, executive director of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy. \u201cWhat has happened in the last couple of years is that you have had a number of additional and very potent voices join the discussion. The upheaval in the Middle East has crystallized recognition that these issues are much bigger than just how many jobs in the upper Midwest are affected. Other industry leaders, outside of the auto industry, are starting to express concern that the volatility of oil and gasoline prices are exposing a fundamental weakness in our economic competitiveness.\u201d\n\nHouse leaders on Tuesday evening were still writing the energy legislation that will reach the House floor this week. In addition to incentives for a huge increase in production of biologically based fuels like ethanol, the package is expected to include a mandate that electric utilities produce 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. House leaders also plan to include $21 billion in new taxes on the oil industry and other interests to pay for the package.\n\nSome aides expressed doubt that the Senate could pass the renewable power mandate or the tax bill, both of which Mr. Bush has threatened to veto.\n\nBusiness interests are beginning a multipronged campaign to defeat the House energy bill and the Senate climate change legislation, claiming both will impose unacceptable costs on American industry. Electric utilities, manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce began a series of print and television advertisements against the measures late last week.\n\nBill Kovacs, the chamber\u2019s vice president for environment and regulatory affairs, said the bills would do little to increase domestic production of energy supplies and would make it hard for industries to compete against foreign companies with fewer regulatory or environmental shackles.\n\nMr. Kovacs said that opposition to these measures cut across partisan and regional lines, depending on where power lines or wind farms are located, for example, or whether increased ethanol production results in higher food or fuel costs.\n\nBut advocates for the bills can and do make the same argument, saying that support for increased fuel economy and measures to combat global warming are now bipartisan and nationwide.\n\nSenator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, is a sponsor of the global warming bill. Mr. Warner opposed weaker legislation when it was proposed two years ago, but said recently that he had changed his mind because of two factors: \u201cscience and my grandchildren.\u201d\n\nA version of this news analysis appears in print on , on Page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Crossing a Threshold On Energy Legislation.

Mr. Robinson remembered being struck by her intelligence and ability to quickly unearth the core emotional truth of a scene. \u201cAnnie jumped right in, without any judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is really an excellent girl.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Robinson conceded that he had been prone to mixing business with pleasure. When he met Ms. Evans, in fact, he was involved with a woman he had begun seeing during a stage production of \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\u201d\n\n\u201cEncountering someone cold, maybe at a bar, then dating? I wouldn\u2019t know how to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the pressure cooker of theatrical work \u2014 all the tension, laughter and intense emotions \u2014 you get to know someone really well, and can segue that into a relationship.\u201d\n\nThough she, too, was smitten by his energy and sense of humor, Ms. Evans said, when she learned that Mr. Robinson was seeing another woman, she \u201cslammed the door\u201d to her heart. \u201cWe could be friends,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing more.\u201d\n\nSlammed door or not, they were sufficiently chummy that Mr. Robinson helped Ms. Evans get her writer\u2019s job at \u201cSesame Street.\u201d And, after 1995, when Mr. Robinson married his girlfriend, who had three children from a previous marriage, Ms. Evans became part of their extended family and was a frequent weekend guest at their house in Connecticut.\n\nMr. Robinson even played matchmaker occasionally, introducing the never-married Ms. Evans to his male friends.\n\nTo no avail. \u201cAnnie went on dates,\u201d said Barbara Jones, an old friend. \u201cHowever, it was also obvious how deeply she cared for Marty. She\u2019d tell me, \u2018I love him, but he\u2019s taken.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the fall of 2001, Mr. Robinson\u2019s marriage began to unravel. He commiserated with Ms. Evans until, in June 2002, he wondered aloud to her if they might not, someday, become more than friends.\n\n\u201cThis was a happy thing to hear, but scary,\u201d Ms. Evans said, adding: \u201cMartin encapsulates everything about life that I find exciting: he is full of life and passion. Not to mention that being around puppets is very sexy \u2014 just look at \u2018Avenue Q\u2019 \u201d\n\nNevertheless, Ms. Evans made a point of dating other men until Mr. Robinson filed for divorce. \u201cI was nervous and wanted to protect myself,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen he became free, the two began what Mr. Robinson described as \u201ca slow but inexorable process of moving from friendship to love.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Robinson, fearful at the possibility of a second failed marriage, hesitated to propose. Five years passed before he gave Ms. Evans an engagement ring, last New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d already been through so much together, no strange hidden things could pop out,\u201d he said of his newfound confidence. \u201cWe were bound by mutual trust.\u201d\n\nWhen the engagement news reached \u201cSesame Street,\u201d co-workers breathed a collective sigh of relief. Nadine Zylstra, one of the show\u2019s directors, said, \u201cThey electrify each other \u2014 their wackiness seems complementary.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 9, 250 people gathered in Studio J at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, where the couple exchanged vows on a staircase of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d set.\n\nTheir wackiness was resplendently on display. Ms. Evans wore a gold lam\u00e9 Grecian toga designed by Mr. Robinson. He sported a silver silk suit with a duster topcoat that skimmed the floor, and a ghoulish tie tack he had made from a prosthetic eyeball.\n\nMs. Evans wrote the script for their ceremony, which featured Oscar the Grouch popping out of a garbage can to heckle the pair about the long and winding road they\u2019d taken to their wedding day.\n\nNo sooner were they pronounced legally wed by the Rev. K. Karpen, a United Methodist minister, than Mr. Robinson caused pandemonium with his surprise announcement that Ms. Evans is pregnant and expecting twins in March. While their friends and family cheered, a string quartet played a sassy recessional of \u201cMaking Whoopee.\u201d\n\nAt the reception, Ms. Evans\u2019s older brother, Jamey, regarded his newlywed sister with a proud smile. \u201cAnnie was eccentric before she met Martin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with their love to fall back on, she\u2019s felt free to follow him way, way over the top.\u201d", "summary": "A mutual admiration between two actors behind the scenes on", "compression": 94.6, "coverage": 0.6, "density": 1.2, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "no_summary_no_strapline", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false, "comment": "Noise"}

More Photos \u00bb\n\nPARIS \u2014 Outwardly, the spring haute couture shows were about the joys of gardening and how many brides you could put on a runway. (Dior, 5; Chanel, 2, though Karl Lagerfeld might have upstaged Raf Simons of Dior by having a pair of lesbian brides.) Not to be left out, the house of Valentino also dug a garden theme.\n\n\u201cReally, we didn\u2019t call Karl and Raf,\u201d Pierpaolo Piccioli, who, with Maria Grazia Chiuri, designs Valentino, said with a laugh.\n\nIt would be O.K. if they had, since the Valentino clothes owed their pure lines and filigree embroidery to garden architecture \u2014 mazes, terraces, curling ironwork \u2014 from the Renaissance. Traced in piping on a cream evening cape or embossed on the stiff skirt of a wool day dress, these patterns are gutsy. They also link Valentino to Italian culture.\n\nWhat Mr. Piccioli and Ms. Chiuri have gained over the last couple of years at Valentino, after a rocky start, is control over their form. This collection has, among other qualities, a strong sense of line, so that the cut and finishing of, say, a caped dress or a deep red strapless gown, stand out.\n\nThe designers are learning to use the extraordinary skills of a couture atelier to be more self-critical and demanding. In just two seasons at Dior, Mr. Simons has used its workrooms to further his ideas and expand his thinking. Mr. Lagerfeld is miles ahead of everyone. He sketches every design, and then turns those sketches over to the women in charge of Chanel\u2019s ateliers, who know how to interpret his drawings. He is able to get precisely what he wants.\n\nThat precision of thought, in a business of compromises, is the virtue of couture, and it\u2019s what Ms. Chiuri and Mr. Piccioli are closer to acquiring. It was evident in their morning-light palette of creams, light tan and pearl white, and in their lace pieces. If the Valentino designers can relate emotionally to Italian stone and iron, they may have found a vital creative key.\n\nA garden is nothing if not the promise of continuity amid change \u2014 the change of colors and seasons, the impertinent arrival of weeds and drought. The garden goes on. By showing some of the same styles he first introduced at Dior, like a sharper Bar jacket trouser suit, Mr. Simons was essentially putting in his hardy perennials. Let\u2019s put it another way: the Chanel cardigan jacket has roots deep in the Paris soil. So does the Bar, but it needs to be cultivated. Mr. Simons is starting that process.\n\nThe remarkable thing about this collection, aside from its colors and ultralight layers, was how easily it introduced asymmetry without pushing the \u201cIt\u2019s unwearable!\u201d button. More than a decade ago, John Galliano brought deconstruction to Dior. Everything was upside down and pulled apart. It was great, but how many people actually wore the clothes the way he showed them?\n\nMr. Simons\u2019s idea is clearest in a suit. Consisting of three pieces, it has a cropped sleeveless jacket, a stiffened camisole with a Bar peplum and a slim skirt with a contrasting hem. There are four colors in all, four fabrics. Each shape is incredibly simple, but it\u2019s the proportion of the shapes, along with the cuts and layering of colors, that makes the suit completely different. I hesitate to say that it redefines the suit, but it sure comes close.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to make the shoulders beautiful,\u201d Mr. Lagerfeld said. Some of the built-out collars of suits and dresses will not flatter every figure, but filling in necklines with white sequined yokes certainly puts the face in good light. Chanel\u2019s misty forest, which also featured dresses with blood-red flowers against a black embroidered ground, provided a warm note of melancholia. It\u2019s an underrated mood in fashion, creating a richness only for those inclined to embrace it.\n\nObserving a cream chiffon gown plumped at the bodice with pale gray feathers, I remarked to Mr. Lagerfeld about the gray.\n\n\u201cBut it would look flat if the feathers were only white,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed. The same could be said about many things.\n\nThe other spring couture shows were good, but not as inspiring. Giorgio Armani put tension into his tailoring, with closefitting silk pants and smart jackets alternating with sexy tops. Baton-shaped ornaments wound into garments were inexplicable, but the jostle of chevron stripes and micro jacquards made a distinctive statement. Donatella Versace also emphasized shoulders in a collection that joyfully subverted pinstriped power suits by repeating the pattern in neon minkand metal mesh. The techniques were impressive.\n\nAlthough Giambattista Valli had some sweet fabrics, his molded shapes looked trapped in couture aspic. He\u2019s capable of a modern attitude. Which is exactly what Bouchra Jarrar showed with her skimmy dresses, an ink-plumed corset and her standout coats in houndstooth and ribbed gray silk.", "summary": "Masters of couture like Karl Lagerfeld of Chanel know that precision is a virtue.

On a crisp morning this fall, they were using chain saws and pulaskis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a firefighting tool that combines an ax and an adz \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to chop overgrown bushes in a private development here, offering a measure of fire prevention for houses built in the wild.\n\nTheir home base is the Arizona State Prison Complex-Lewis, but when asked where they are from, the reply is simply \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuckeye,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the name of the town where the prison is located. If there are other questions, they call it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgated community\u00e2\u0080\u009d and leave it at that.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re inmates is the last thing on anybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said John Chleboun, 33, who has been serving time for burglary at the Lewis complex and is entering his second year with the crew.\n\nAs federal agencies have cut costs during the budget standoffs in Washington, further decreasing the size of a firefighting work force that has already been reduced by 40 percent since the 1980s, the burden of fighting wildfires has been shifted to states and local jurisdictions, even as they struggle under the weight of a sluggish economy. Prison crews, cheap and dependable, have emerged as a solution as wildfires burn bigger, hotter and longer each year and take up a growing portion of the United States Forest Service budget. (In 2012 alone, federal agencies spent $1.9 billion on wildfire suppression, just shy of the record, set in 2006.)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very cost-effective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Julie Hutchinson, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which has the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest and largest inmate firefighting program: roughly 4,000 prisoners and 200 crews. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out in the community, paying back for their mistakes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStates log significant savings, paying inmates a small fraction of the reimbursement fees paid to federal agencies for using their teams to fight fires or the price of hiring private companies to do the work the prisoners do in the off-peak season, like picking up trash along highways in Nevada, maintaining hiking trails in Colorado, and thinning forests and removing dried vegetation all across the region.\n\nCalifornia pays inmates $1 per hour for work in emergencies like fires and floods, saving the state an estimated $80 million per year, according to forestry and fire protection statistics. In Nevada, where inmates work for the same pay, they bring in around $3.5 million in annual revenue from the nonfirefighting projects for which they are hired, said Jody Weintz, who manages the program for the Nevada Division of Forestry. (Noninmate firefighters earn around $10 an hour, as well as hazard pay and overtime.)\n\nIn Arizona, the pay for inmates is among the lowest in the country: 50 cents an hour. In Colorado, which had the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-highest rate of recidivism in 2010, 52.5 percent, the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supervisor estimated that fewer than 25 percent of the inmates released after working on wilderness firefighting teams returned.\n\nSome firefighting experts, however, do not believe that the social calculus makes much sense.\n\nWilderness firefighting \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a line of work where there are more people looking for jobs than there are jobs available,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stephen J. Pyne, a professor at the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University and a former wilderness firefighter who has written numerous books about the history and mechanics of wildfires. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are we turning that over to prison crews?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile inmates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pay is low, there are other rewards. Arizona inmates work outdoors much of the year, and if they are out fighting fires, their status as inmates is not easy to discern. In California, inmates wear orange fire-retardant jumpsuits and sleep in separate camps when they are out on fire lines. But firefighting inmates in Arizona wear the same clothes as other wilderness firefighters.\n\nThey eat and sleep in the same cafeterias and campsites, an arrangement that defies the rigid relationship barriers enforced inside prison walls. They also undergo the same training required of other wilderness firefighters and pass a physical assessment known as a pack test: traveling three miles on foot in 45 minutes, carrying 45 pounds on their backs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to have the heart, the strength and the willingness to do the job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jake Guadiana, an Arizona State Forestry coordinator and the boss of the Lewis crew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not the place for you if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a free meal and some time out of prison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSometimes the inmates try to take advantage of the light supervision and escape. Mr. Weintz, in Nevada, said that happened \u00e2\u0080\u009conce or twice a year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but as far as he could tell, escapees were always taken back to prison, though not to the firefighting program. A clean disciplinary record is one condition of participation. Another is being in prison for a nonviolent offense.\n\nMore commonly, program managers say, the inmates leave prison at the end of their sentences and join firefighting crews. One of them, Grant Lovato, 46, who worked two seasons with the Lewis crew while serving time in prison for credit card fraud and identity theft, is now a firefighter for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Gulfport, Miss. In a telephone interview, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea that I could be in prison and still get out into the woods and get to enjoy the nature was a transformative experience to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe job has strict rules, like no phone calls or visits while on assignment, and carries many risks. Five inmates and a correctional officer died in June 1990 in the Dude Fire, near Payson, Ariz., sparked by a bolt of lightning, just like the fire in Yarnell. There have been other fatalities and numerous injuries, but none seem to weigh too heavily on the inmates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minds.\n\nHis helmet tucked under his arm, a mountain peak visible behind him against a bright blue sky, Armando Gloria, 29, who is serving time for robbery at the Lewis prison and is on his third season with its firefighting crew, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fear, yes, but when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out there, fighting fire, the fear becomes more like an adrenaline rush.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "summary": "States like Arizona, California and Nevada are relying more on cheap, dependable prison crews as cuts shrink professional firefighting forces and wildfires burn bigger, hotter and longer.", "compression": 39.5806451613, "coverage": 0.8387096774, "density": 2.3225806452, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

He brought with him a handful of his cabinet ministers, including Joe Oliver, his tough-talking minister of natural resources who, until recently, had been withering in his scorn for the opponents of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which President Obama rejected a few weeks ago. The pipeline, of course, was intended to transport vast oil reserves in Alberta to the American refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOliver no longer talks so freely about the environmental critics of the Keystone pipeline; all of Harper\u2019s ministers have been instructed to stop making comments that might be construed as interfering in the American presidential election. But there are other, more diplomatic, ways to send messages. Like going to China with your cabinet members and cutting energy deals with a country that has, as The Globe and Mail in Toronto put it recently, a \u201cthirst for Canadian oil.\u201d Oil, I might add, that may be a little dirtier than the crude that pours forth from the Saudi Arabian desert \u2014 that is one of the main reasons environmentalists say they oppose Keystone \u2014 but is hardly the environmental disaster many suppose.\n\nI realize that President Obama rejected Keystone because, politically, he had no choice. My guess is that, in his centrist heart of hearts, the president wanted to approve it. But to give the go-ahead before the election was to risk losing the support of the environmentalists who make up an important part of his base.\n\nI also understand that the Republican decision to force Obama\u2019s hand was a political stunt, allowing them to denounce his decision during the campaign. As Jennifer Steinhauer put it in The Times recently, \u201cRepublicans are framing Keystone as an urgent jobs and energy project at a time of high unemployment and creeping gasoline prices.\u201d\n\nSurely, though, what the Keystone decision really represents is the way our poisoned politics damages the country. Environmental concerns notwithstanding, America will be using oil \u2014 and lots of it \u2014 for the foreseeable future. It is the fundamental means by which we transport ourselves, whether by air, car or truck. Where do we get that oil? Mostly from countries that don\u2019t like us, like Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s second-largest oil reserves.\n\nAnd here is Canada, a staunch American ally that has historically sold us virtually all of its crude exports. Over the past two decades, energy companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in the tar sands, so much so that Canada now ranks No. 3 in estimated oil reserves. Along with the natural gas that can now be extracted thanks to hydraulic fracturing \u2014 which, of course, all right-thinking environmentalists also oppose \u2014 the oil from the Canadian tar sands ought to be viewed as a great gift that has been handed to North America. These two relatively new sources of fossil fuels offer America its first real chance in decades to become, if not energy self-sufficient, at least energy secure, no longer beholden to OPEC. Yet these gifts have been transformed, like everything else, into political footballs.\n\nIn Canada, the Keystone XL controversy has created a surprising new resolve. \u201cKeystone was a transformative turning point in terms of how Harper sees the bilateral relationship,\u201d says Fen Hampson, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa. Instead of blithely assuming the United States would purchase its oil, Canada is now determined to find diverse buyers so it won\u2019t be held hostage by American politics. Hence, the newfound willingness to do business with China. Canada has concluded that it simply can\u2019t expect much from the United States, even on an issue that would seem to be vital to our own interests.\n\nAs it turns out, the environmental movement doesn\u2019t just want to shut down Keystone. Its real goal, as I discovered when I spoke recently to Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, is much bigger. \u201cThe effort to stop Keystone is part of a broader effort to stop the expansion of the tar sands,\u201d Brune said. \u201cIt is based on choking off the ability to find markets for tar sands oil.\u201d\n\nThis is a ludicrous goal. If it were to succeed, it would be deeply damaging to the national interest of both Canada and the United States. But it has no chance of succeeding. Energy is the single most important industry in Canada. Three-quarters of the Canadian public agree with the Harper government\u2019s diversification strategy. China\u2019s \u201cthirst\u201d for oil is hardly going to be deterred by the Sierra Club. And the Harper government views the continued development of the tar sands as a national strategic priority.\n\nThus, at least one country in North America understands where its national interests lie.

It found that most people \u201cwere opposed to the plan,\u201d arguing it could make the community a terrorist target, but that others characterized these concerns as \u201chysteria.\u201d\n\nTo produce the report about Standish, the contractor used \u201cFacebook, Twitter, three different blogs and reader comments\u201d on an article on The Washington Post\u2019s Web site, highlighting \u201cpublic sentiments in extensive detail,\u201d according to a summary of the report that was included as an example in a \u201cSocial Networking/Media Capability Analyst Handbook\u201d dated February 2010.\n\nAsked about the Standish report on Friday, department officials provided a series of explanations. After initially accepting it as something produced by the program, an official later said the report was instead created by a contractor as a sample during a period when the social networking component of its media monitoring program was still being designed. It started on a small scale in January 2010 and expanded the following June.\n\nChris Ortman, a department spokesman, acknowledged that the report was included in the February 2010 handbook, but he said it was there \u201conly as an example of a weekly report format.\u201d No such report on public sentiment was ever distributed as a working document of the department\u2019s National Operations Center, which runs the monitoring program, he said.\n\nHe added that the handbook had since been revised and no longer included that example because it \u201cdoes not meet our operational requirements or privacy standards,\u201d which \u201cexpressly prohibit reporting on individuals\u2019 First Amendment activities.\u201d\n\nThe report about Standish residents was part of nearly 300 pages of documents about the monitoring program obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nGinger McCall, director of the group\u2019s Open Government Program, said it was appropriate for the department to use the Internet to search for emerging threats to public safety. But, she said, monitoring what people are saying about government policies went too far and could chill free speech.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s monitoring of political dissent has no legal basis and is contrary to core First Amendment principles,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also pointed out that while other sample reports in the February 2010 handbook discuss content that is inappropriate and should be removed, the Standish one does not. \u201cThis Standish report is being held up, as is, as an example that should be emulated,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the names of blog and mainstream news sources are logged in the sample reports, the documents show that such reports \u2014 whatever their topic \u2014 are not to include personally identifying information; for example, a quotation taken from Twitter would say it came from \u201ca Twitter user\u201d rather than citing a specific Twitter account.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, John Cohen, the department\u2019s principal deputy counterterrorism coordinator, said the broader media-monitoring program dated to 2006 and had evolved over time. He said that it had extensive privacy protections and that policy makers had decided that they did not want reports like Standish because they were not helpful.\n\n\u201cToday this capability is focused solely on rapidly identifying and obtaining information regarding events that are ongoing, and providing information that can help inform an effective response to that event,\u201d he said, describing the reports as covering only topics like \u201cmajor traffic accidents, haz-mat spills, reports regarding suspicious packages, shootings, etc.\u201d\n\nThis week, Reuters reported on a department privacy review related to the monitoring efforts that described the news media channels the program covers. The Reuters report received significant attention after The Drudge Report, a popular news aggregation Web site, highlighted that Drudge was on the list.\n\nMany of the newly disclosed documents relate to the department\u2019s efforts to outsource some of its \u201cmedia monitoring and social media/networking support services.\u201d In early 2010, for example, companies seeking the contract had to spend 24 hours monitoring news media coverage.\n\nThey were asked to produce short reports about threats and hazards, as well as \u201cany media reports that reflect adversely on the U.S. Government and the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) ability to prevent, protect and respond, to recovery efforts or activities related to any crisis or events which impact National Planning Scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe documents indicate that in May 2010 a procurement official awarded an $11.3 million contract to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems.\n\nOne passage in the documents raised another question. It says the program should also compile reports about the department and other federal agencies, including \u201cboth positive and negative reports on FEMA, C.I.A., C.B.P., ICE, etc., as well as organizations outside of D.H.S.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the acronyms stand for agencies dealing with emergencies, border security and the like, \u201cC.I.A.\u201d usually refers to the Central Intelligence Agency.

Swarthmore and Pomona planned to take 15 to 20 students from the wait list, admissions officials said.\n\nAt Bowdoin College, William Shain said he was slightly over the 480-student target, \u201cbut not so much that going to the waiting list is out of the question, if we lost a lot to other schools.\u201d\n\nSome high school guidance counselors said the wait-list activity this year seemed to have occurred especially quickly.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years, more and more kids have been getting put on wait lists,\u201d said Margaret Loonam, assistant principal at Ridgewood High School in New Jersey. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing more get off the wait lists and earlier. It used to be a formal letter.\n\n\u201cBut this year, it\u2019s still early May and we\u2019ve had a kid who got a call at home at night saying, \u2018You\u2019re off the wait list, do you want to come?\u2019 We\u2019ve already had kids get off waitlists at N.Y.U., B.U., Fairfield and Quinnipiac.\u201d\n\nAt the University of Virginia, which also ended early admissions this year, John Blackburn, the dean of admission, said because he had received 3,200 deposits for a target of 3,170 freshman, he might not go to the wait list, unless an unusual number of students defect to other colleges.\n\nMr. Blackburn said he considered the move from early admissions a success because it seemed that, as hoped, it had brought in more low-income students.\n\nHarvard, which ended early admissions this year and greatly expanded its financial aid to middle-income families, sent out offers of admissions to 1,948 students March 31, for a freshman class that is to number 1,650.

Everything has become so fragmented that no single sight or sound is fixed. Human voices and mechanical hiccups are given equal weight. And people are never simply themselves. Why, at a given moment, you can pick from five or six versions of that shiny-eyed seductress who rules the stage at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn.\n\nShould you watch her on all those television monitors, where her face keeps dividing, multiplying, freezing, melting and changing color? Or should you just do what you usually do at the theater and focus on - you should pardon the expression - the real thing? That is not as obvious a choice as you might think, since the flesh-and-blood woman (her name is Kate Valk, and she may well be the most accomplished actress in New York) seems a little less complete, less fulfilled than her videocast self.\n\nSuch is the universe that has been so brilliantly and bewilderingly summoned into being in \"House/Lights,\" the 1999 chef-d'oeuvre of the Wooster Group, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. The show, inspired by a Gertrude Stein opera libretto (\"Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights\"), has been restaged at St. Ann's through April 10.\n\nOverseen by Elizabeth LeCompte, the troupe's longtime artistic director, \"House/Lights\" is one crazy, exotic head trip, right? Well, not unless that's how you regard everyday existence in the early 21st century.\n\nThe world according to the Wooster Group is the world that most of us live in now - any of us, that is, who spend time with some kind of computer, cellphone, television and/or recording device. Heck, just take a stroll through that open-air sound-and-light show called Times Square, land of giant television screens and walking telephone conversations, and you'll be in the terrain mapped by the Wooster Group.\n\nThe company has become the American theater's most inspired and articulate interpreter of an age in which machines mediate between the perceiver and the perceived, between subject and object. In its productions of the last 15 years in particular, it has increasingly specialized in ravishing, meticulous marriages of live and recorded performance that make it shatteringly clear reality ain't what it used to be.\n\nThe Wooster Group, which has kept nimble pace with changes in industrial science in ways that big old bumbling Broadway can only envy, isn't exactly what it used to be either. Its early productions were principally a showcase for the stylized stand-up autobiography of Spalding Gray, the monologuist extraordinaire and founding member of the group, who died last year.\n\nFrom there, the company, whose other founders included Ms. Valk and the movie-star-to-be Willem Dafoe, moved on to more iconoclastic fare that captured currents rippling through international academia and the art world of downtown New York. High-low, deconstruction, postmodernism - all those now weary buzzwords were embodied in splashy, trendier-than-thou style by the Wooster Group in the 1980's.\n\nClassic American theater texts, from \"Our Town\" to \"The Crucible,\" were poached, fried and scrambled with elements that ranged from blackface minstrel shows to simulated LSD trips. Mainstream critics sneered, but high-bohemian audiences thronged to the Performing Garage in SoHo, which the company had inherited from Richard Schechner's Performance Group in 1980. The Wooster Group was too cool, you might have thought, to stay hot, or even to stay together.\n\nBut when the company latched on to the work of Eugene O'Neill in the early 1990's, it became clear that it belonged to a deeply rooted artistic tradition. O'Neill remains the greatest of the experimentalists among American dramatists, a writer who found in the exaggerations of Expressionism a means of conveying the dehumanization of an increasingly industrialized environment.\n\nHe was, in other words, a ready-made soul mate for the Wooster Group. The company's productions of O'Neill's \"Hairy Ape\" (which transferred for a limited run at the Selwyn Theater on 42nd Street in 1997) and \"Emperor Jones\" were reinterpretive masterpieces.

Wheeler had a difficult childhood and few options. The Army offered an escape, but it turned into much more. He made a career in uniform, becoming a highly decorated combat veteran in the elite and secretive Delta Force.\n\n\u201cIn that area, if you didn\u2019t go to college, you basically had a choice of the oil fields or the military,\u201d said his uncle, Jack Shamblin. \u201cThe Army really suited him; he always had such robust energy and he always wanted to help people, and he felt he was doing that.\u201d\n\nThat protective instinct was evident from grade school when, as the oldest child in a dysfunctional home, he was often the one who made sure his siblings were clothed and fed. And it was on display on Thursday, when Master Sergeant Wheeler, 39, a father of four who was thinking of retiring from the Army, became the first American in four years to die in combat in Iraq.\n\nWhen Kurdish commandos went on a helicopter raid to rescue about 70 hostages who were about to be executed by Islamic State militants, the plan called for the Americans who accompanied them to offer support, not join in the action, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said on Friday. But then the Kurdish attack on the prison where the hostages were held stalled, and Sergeant Wheeler responded.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton B. Carter spoke of Master Sgt. Joshua L. Wheeler, an American soldier killed in Iraq while working with Kurdish forces known as pesh merga fighters against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cHe ran to the sound of the guns,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re very saddened that he lost his life,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of this young man.\u201d\n\nA former Delta Force officer who had commanded Sergeant Wheeler in Iraq and had been briefed on the mission said that the Kurdish fighters, known as pesh merga, tried to blast a hole in the compound\u2019s outer wall, but could not. Sergeant Wheeler and another American, part of a team of 10 to 20 Delta Force operators who were present, ran up to the wall, breached it with explosives, and were the first ones through the hole.\n\n\u201cWhen you blow a hole in a compound wall, all the enemy fire gets directed toward that hole, and that is where he was,\u201d said the former officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation. The military does not officially acknowledge the existence of the Delta Force, the Army counterpart to Navy SEAL teams.\n\nAerial reconnaissance had shown a newly dug mass grave at the prison, and the hostages were to be killed on the morning of the raid, Mr. Carter said. \u201cThat location was planned to be an execution center.\u201d\n\nThe mission was a success, and the hostages were freed. A few of the pesh merga fighters were injured.\n\nThe only rescuer who died was Sergeant Wheeler, a veteran of 14 deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, with a chest full of medals. His honors included four Bronze Stars with the letter V, awarded for valor in combat; and seven Bronze Stars, awarded for heroic or meritorious service in a combat zone. His body will be returned to the United States on Saturday.\n\nHe died far from his roots in Sequoyah County, Okla., just across the state border from Fort Smith, Ark.\n\nHis mother, Diane, had two marriages to troubled and abusive men, both ending in divorce, said Mr. Shamblin, her brother. She had two sons with her first husband and three daughters with her second, and outlived both men. She died last year at age 60.\n\nOne of Sergeant Wheeler\u2019s sisters, Rachel Quackenbush, said her parents were \u201cmentally gone.\u201d Family members said that they often got by on some form of government assistance. Later in life, their mother, who was part Cherokee, like many people in the region, received help from the Cherokee nation.\n\nIt was her brother who held them together, making sure the younger children ate breakfast, got dressed and made it to school \u2014 even changing dirty diapers. On his own initiative, Mr. Shamblin said, he held a variety of jobs, including roofing and work on a blueberry farm, to bring in a few extra dollars.\n\nSergeant Wheeler\u2019s grandparents, now in their 80s, often took care of the children. \u201cThey were the only really stable influence,\u201d Mr. Shamblin said.\n\nMs. Quackenbush, 30, recalled one of her brother\u2019s first visits home from the military, when she was still a child. He noticed that the pantries were bare, retrieved a gun and left. \u201cHe went out and he shot a deer,\u201d she said. \u201cHe made us deer meat and cooked us dinner.\u201d\n\nBut at Muldrow High School, where he graduated in 1994, people saw no sign of the turmoil at home.\n\n\u201cHe was always funny, even mischievous, but always the guy who seemed like he had your back,\u201d said April Isa, a classmate who now teaches English at the high school. \u201cMost of our class was cliques, but he wasn\u2019t with just one group. He was friends with everyone.\u201d\n\nRon Flanagan, the Muldrow schools superintendent, was the assistant principal at the high school when Sergeant Wheeler attended classes there. \u201cThe thing I remember most clearly is that he was extremely respectful to everybody, classmates and teachers,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a good kid who didn\u2019t get in any trouble.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler enlisted in 1995, and in 1997 he joined the Rangers, a specially trained group within the Army.\n\nFrom 2004, he was assigned to Army Special Operations Command, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., which includes Delta Force, the extremely selective unit that carries out some of the military\u2019s riskiest operations. He completed specialized training in several fields, including parachute jumping, mountaineering, leading infantry units, explosives and urban combat.\n\n\u201cHe was very focused, knew his job in and out,\u201d said the former officer who had commanded Sergeant Wheeler. \u201cIt is hard to describe these guys. They are taciturn, very introspective, but extremely competent. They are Jason Bournes, they really are.\u201d\n\nHe had three sons by his first marriage, which ended in divorce.

Ms. Quackenbush said that when he would have to leave on another deployment, he would claim it was just for training, which she understood was untrue.\n\n\u201cHe was exactly what was right about this world,\u201d she said. \u201cHe came from nothing and he really made something out of himself.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on October 24, 2015, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Life Recreated in Army Ends in Combat .

In olden days, when \u201cTobacco Road\u201d ruled Broadway in the 1930s, slick urbanites couldn\u2019t get enough of such moonshine. But now, except for those occasions when Tracy Letts (\u201cKiller Joe\u201d) is feeling folksy and perverse, that genre has been reduced to festering on reality television.\n\nSo hats off (preferably accessorized with bullet holes and grease stains) to Keith Josef Adkins, who has reclaimed this rich and odoriferous territory for the stage with \u201cPitbulls.\u201d This resplendently foul-mouthed production at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater dares to present, as one character says, \u201ctrailer trash in its natural habitat.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Virgil (Billy Eugene Jones), the mean and blackmailing sheriff, speaking to our defiant heroine, Mary (Yvette Ganier), who is the object of desire, fear and derision of many a soul in the Ohio River valley woods where she parks her rusting trailer. Mary is a maker of \u201creal grape wine\u201d (secret ingredient: her own blood), which she has her overgrown son, Dipper (Maurice Williams), sell to passing cars on the offramp.\n\nRumor has it that she has her boy doing other, awful things, too, like burning American flags on the Fourth of July and killing pit bulls. In an early scene that made me think I definitely wasn\u2019t wasting my time by attending this play, Mary asks to sniff her son\u2019s fingers for the smell of smoke to see if he has performed as commanded. It\u2019s a request to which Dipper responds, with terse eloquence, \u201cWeird.\u201d\n\nBut who really killed Heaper, the pit bull whose mangled head shows up in a bowling bag, remains a mystery until the show\u2019s end. The slaying has far-reaching implications on this Fourth of July, when the mayor\u2019s annual Summit of the Pitbulls (in which the creatures fight to the death) takes place, and the town has hopes of positioning itself as the pit bull capital of the world\n\nDirected by Leah C. Gardiner, this premiere of \u201cPitbulls\u201d can feel overly relaxed when you want it to burn with creepy urgency. A tauter, more tensely acted production might help you overlook some plot holes and some symbolic poeticizing that\u2019s tacked on toward the end. (It becomes clear that the fighting of pit bulls is a metaphor for the internecine struggles of poor, rural African-Americans like these.)\n\nBut it has many of the requisite accouterments that make trailer-trash melodrama such guilty fun, including a set by Andrew Boyce that features a corroded washing machine sitting in the woods and a central performance of heroic blowsiness by Ms. Ganier. And the dialogue is as flavorful as pulled-pork barbecue marinated in a piquant secret sauce.\n\nThis is a play in which a lay minister (Nathan Hinton) catalogs the \u201cnormal, everyday sins\u201d he\u2019s committed as including \u201cgambling, drunkenness and sex in a state park with a cousin.\u201d His jealous wife (Donna Duplantier) warns Mary, \u201cYou better keep your sticky hands off my husband, or I\u2019ll sic Christ on you.\u201d\n\nThe play goes a bit saggy and sentimental at its end. But it\u2019s hard to discount the linguistic verve that features the, uh, resonant description of a Pitbull Summit past, \u201cwhen a pit gave birth to a double-headed puppy right under the flag \u2014 afterbirth just sitting there, cooking in the sun.\u201d\n\nBy Keith Josef Adkins; directed by Leah C.

So he will move his arms, sway with the music, pace back and forth, hoping his energy will somehow become hers. And he will utter instructions under his breath: Pull in, relax, push, push.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s me I\u2019m talking to, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Orser said with a laugh.\n\nMore than anyone, he understands the pressure and expectation that Kim faces as an Olympic favorite and what will confront her during Thursday\u2019s free skate \u0097 ecstatic victory or knee-buckling defeat.\n\nA Canadian, Orser was also a defending world champion and the gold medal choice of many as the 1988 Winter Olympics approached in Calgary, Alberta. He faced up to the pressure but stepped out of a triple flip during his long program, losing the so-called Battle of the Brians to Brian Boitano by the narrowest of marks \u0097 one-tenth of one point on one judge\u2019s tie-breaker mark.\n\n\u201cThat triple flip haunted me forever,\u201d Orser said.\n\nTwenty-two years later, the Winter Games have returned to Canada and Orser has a chance to spin his silver medal frustration into vicarious gold. It is not the same thing, winning as a coach and winning as an athlete. The medal would be Kim\u2019s, not Orser\u2019s. But her victory would bring some deliverance and symmetry to his career, where triumph has been elusive and defeat has been excruciating.\n\n\u201cIf you want to reach your own potential, sometimes you have to help someone else reach theirs,\u201d said Uschi Keszler, a former coach of Orser\u2019s.\n\nIt is the pitiless Olympic nature that one often does not win the silver as much as lose the gold. Few comprehend this as painfully as Orser. At the 1984 Sarajevo Games, he won the short and long programs but finished second to Scott Hamilton after taking seventh in compulsory figures.\n\nThen came the Calgary Games. Orser thought he had skated well enough to win. When he didn\u2019t, he walked into the locker room and congratulated Boitano, then lay on the floor near the showers.\n\n\u201cHe was in a daze, like he was drugged out,\u201d Boitano said.\n\nCanada had failed to win a gold medal while hosting the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, and now its best hope in Calgary had come up short. Later that night, Orser returned to the Olympic Village and tried to sleep on a cot in a medical room, alone in a sterile facility with his consolation medal. It was awful. For 10 years, he could not watch a replay of his performance.\n\n\u201cI never saw myself as other than an Olympic champion,\u201d Orser, now 48, said. \u201cI never imagined not winning. Canada had hosted two Olympics and had no gold medals, the only host country not to win any. I took that personally. I felt I let everyone down.\u201d\n\nTime has dulled his disappointment. Video of Orser\u2019s performance in Calgary is now used to train judges. At these Vancouver Games, Canada finally won its first gold medal on home soil. So there is no longer that burden to carry.\n\nAnd now there is karmic precedent for coaching redemption. After three decades of silver-medal disappointment, Frank Carroll coaxed a golden performance from Evan Lysacek in the men\u2019s competition Thursday. Orser will attempt to do the same with Kim.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky we kept her in skating,\u201d Orser said in a recent interview, speaking of himself and Kim\u2019s choreographer, David Wilson.\n\nWhen Kim arrived in Toronto in 2006 to work with Wilson, she seemed unhappy and discouraged, Orser said. Exhaustive training, in which Kim was forced by her mother and her coaches to keep repeating missed jumps, also left her with a bulging disk in her back.\n\nShe was a world junior champion at 15, but she was also gawky. Her mood seemed as constricting as her braces.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have the confidence of just being a young woman on the ice,\u201d said Orser, who agreed to coach her. \u201cWe started chipping away, trying to expose this humor and spirit that we knew was in there. We got her to understand she could listen to her body and take time to rest and do the proper physiotherapy. She started coming out of her shell. She has developed a great awareness of movement and music.\u201d\n\nHis laconic coaching style allows for input from Kim\u2019s mother. And as pressure has mounted on Kim in South Korea, the way it did two decades ago on him in Canada, Orser has become a knowing sounding board.\n\nWhen Kim seemed miserable in the fall of 2008, frequently missing jumps, he comforted her, saying, \u201cNobody knows what you\u2019re going through except for me.\u201d\n\nAs these Olympics approached, Orser\u2019s main concern was to keep everyone calm in Kim\u2019s entourage. He has encouraged her and her mother not to worry about skating blogs \u0097 and to stop believing everything they read.\n\n\u201cI only had to worry about telegrams,\u201d Orser said.\n\nHe has tried to deflect attention away from himself, and toward Kim. If she wins, Orser joked, he will not run to the medal podium to claim the gold he lost in 1988.\n\n\u201cBut maybe deep down, yes, it might make up for it a little bit,\u201d Orser said. \u201cAsk me when it\u2019s over.\u201d", "summary": "The Canadian failed in his dream to win a gold medal in figure skating, but he still has a chance to help a South Korean skater win.", "compression": 38.5517241379, "coverage": 0.8620689655, "density": 2.1034482759, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

For the past several weeks, as the polls have shown Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee, gaining increasing ground, Mr. McCain\u2019s traveling road show has veered from message to message and from pumping up hostile crowds to trying to calm them down. Each news cycle seems to bring another tactic as the campaign appears to be trying anything and everything to see what might work.\n\nHis temporary embrace of Mr. Obama came as Mr. McCain was repeatedly implored by voters at the town-hall-style meeting to \u201cfight back\u201d against Mr. Obama at the next presidential debate, on Wednesday, and to stop him from becoming president. But unlike at an earlier town-hall-style meeting this week in Wisconsin, where Mr. McCain sharply agreed with voters who urged him to punch back, this time he drew a line.\n\nWhen a man told him he was \u201cscared\u201d of an Obama presidency, Mr. McCain replied, \u201cI want to be president of the United States and obviously I do not want Senator Obama to be, but I have to tell you \u2014 I have to tell you \u2014 he is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared\" of \"as president of the United States.\u201d The crowd booed loudly at Mr. McCain\u2019s response.\n\nLater, a woman stood up at the meeting, held at Lakeville South High School in a far suburb of Minneapolis, and told Mr. McCain that she could not trust Mr. Obama because he was an \u201cArab.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain replied: \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a decent family man, citizen who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d At that, the crowd applauded.\n\nMr. McCain and his campaign have been harshly criticized this week by Mr. Obama, Democrats, some Republicans and a number of columnists, commentators and editorial writers for stoking angry crowds at rallies, particularly those in which Mr. McCain appears with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.\n\nCrowds in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have repeatedly booed Mr. Obama and yelled \u201coff with his head,\u201d and at a rally in Florida where Ms. Palin appeared without Mr. McCain, The Washington Post reported that a man yelled out \u201ckill him.\u201d At the same rally, a racial insult was hurled at an African-American television cameraman.\n\nRepresentative Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said Friday in an interview that he was surprised that neither Mr. McCain nor Ms. Palin had reacted, either by chastising audience members or discussing the events later. \u201cIt concerns me greatly when people come to the point where they take a political race, a race for president, and holler out words like \u2018kill him,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI just think our country is so much better than that.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Mr. McCain\u2019s advisers sought to minimize the impact of those images of angry voters that have repeatedly been broadcast on television in the last two days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big a deal,\u201d Rick Davis, Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign manager, told reporters in a conference call on Friday. \u201cI think political rallies have always attracted people who have an emotional connection to the outcome of an election.\u201d\n\nNicolle Wallace, one of Mr. McCain\u2019s senior aides, tried to turn the tables on Mr. Obama on Friday and accuse him of denigrating the people who go to Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin\u2019s rallies. \u201cBroadsides against our supporters are insulting,\u201d she said. \u201cHe attacks the same people he once called bitter.\u201d\n\nWithin the campaign, there is a difference of opinion on the attacks, and some of Mr. McCain\u2019s closest advisers have felt he should also criticize Mr. Obama for his ties to his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. But they say Mr. McCain believes that if he does so, he will be accused of racism.\n\n\u201cI personally believe that Jeremiah Wright is a legitimate issue to bring up,\u201d one of Mr. McCain\u2019s top advisers said. \u201cBut the candidate is refusing to do that out of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain appeared far more cheerful and relaxed at the town-hall-style meeting in Lakeville than he has at any other recent campaign event. He smiled broadly, laughed easily and told a number of well-worn jokes from similar forums of a year ago. He kept the event going for more than an hour, even after his aides said it was time to bring it to a close.\n\nBut although the crowd was not as large and angry as previous crowds \u2014 Ms. Palin appears to attract greater numbers of frustrated voters \u2014 Mr. McCain at numerous points had to try to tone down the intensity.\n\nAt one point, after a voter told him he wanted to see a \u201creal fight\u201d at the debate and the crowd responded with a roar, Mr. McCain replied, \u201cWe want to fight, and I will fight, but we will be respectful.\u201d\n\nThen he added, \u201cI admire Senator Obama and his accomplishments, I will respect him.\u201d The crowd interrupted Mr. McCain to boo, but he kept talking. \u201cI want everyone to be respectful and let\u2019s make sure we are, because that\u2019s the way politics should be conducted in America.\"\n\nAt that point, the crowd applauded.\n\nBecause of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the changing tactics of Senator John McCain\u2019s campaign misstated, in some editions, Mr. McCain\u2019s reaction to a woman\u2019s comment at his rally in Lakeville, Minn., that Senator Barack Obama was not trustworthy because he was an \u201cArab.\u201d Mr. McCain told the woman, \u201cNo Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a decent family man, citizen.\u201d Mr. McCain did not fail to respond to the woman\u2019s accusation.\n\nAdam Nagourney contributed reporting from New York.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: McCain Draws Line on Attacks as Crowds Cry \u2018Fight Back\u2019.

A point guard for Wake Forest, Packer did not have a memorable night, as St. John\u2019s Ivan Kovac effectively defended him throughout the game, but the Demon Deacons prevailed, 97-74.\n\nAfter leaving CBS in 2008, where he worked as a college basketball analyst for 27 years, Packer no longer studies the game with the same intensity and may not even watch when the tournament returns to Manhattan this weekend.\n\nReflecting on the 1961 tournament at Madison Square Garden, Packer said the night resulted in a mixture of triumph and tragedy that altered the future of college basketball because of a point-shaving scandal that he unexpectedly found himself enmeshed in.\n\nTo qualify for the N.C.A.A. tournament, Wake Forest defeated Duke, 96-81, in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship at Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, N.C. Packer scored 16 points, and Len Chappell led the Demon Deacons with 33 points. The day before their matchup, St. John\u2019s Coach Joe Lapchick told The New York Times that Packer, \u201calthough small at 5 feet 11 inches, is a definite threat.\u201d\n\nSt. John\u2019s participation in the tournament was surprising. The Times reported in February 1961 that the National Invitation Tournament, also to be held at the Garden, was counting on the team \u2014 then known as the Redmen \u2014 to draw a large home crowd. St. John\u2019s Athletic Director Walter McLaughlin said at the time that the university entered the N.C.A.A. tournament instead out of a desire for a \u201cchange of pace.\u201d St. John\u2019s had appeared in the N.I.T. 15 times since 1939, more than any other team.\n\nWake Forest had played in the Garden for the first time earlier in the season, losing to New York University. To relax before the St. John\u2019s game, Packer said the team went to a movie theater on Broadway to watch \u201cSpartacus,\u201d but were unaware of its more than three-hour running time and returned to their hotel having missed curfew.\n\n\u201cKirk Douglas was so good in that movie, we took the gamble,\u201d Packer said.\n\nEarly on, the Demon Deacons played sluggishly against St. John\u2019s, which, at 20-4, was a favorite to contend for the national title, led by Tony Jackson, LeRoy Ellis and Willie Hall. Packer said that with Wake Forest trailing at halftime, 46-36, and with Jackson\u2019s outside shooting pacing St. John\u2019s, Coach Bones McKinney asked his players if anybody could \u201cput an elbow right up through his nose on the next jump shot.\u201d\n\nInstead, Wake Forest neutralized Jackson by switching to a three-guard lineup and commenced a 33-point swing in the second half, led by the post play of the 6-foot-8, 240-pound Chappell and Bill Hull, who Packer said he recruited from the football team after the lineup was decimated by injuries earlier in the season.\n\nPacker, who scored only 5 points, remembered the game as particularly bruising. Lapchick and McKinney had played against each other in the N.B.A., Packer said, and \u201cthere was a rivalry between those two fellas.\u201d A majority of the 18,327 fans in attendance rooted for St. John\u2019s, and the Wake Forest captain Jerry Steele had to leave the game after an inadvertent elbow from Ellis fractured his eye socket.\n\nAs the Demon Deacons retreated to their hotel to rest before taking a train to Charlotte for the next round\u2019s games, Packer was in his room when his friend Dick Markowitz knocked on the door. Markowitz played for George Washington, which had lost that night to Princeton, 84-67, in the first game of what was an N.C.A.A. tournament tripleheader that concluded with the Wake Forest-St. John\u2019s matchup.\n\nCredit Larry C. Morris/The New York Times\n\nAfter the loss, Packer said, Markowitz had gone out for the night. But when Markowitz returned he discovered his team had traveled back to Washington, and he now needed a place to stay. Packer had a roommate but was able to put Markowitz up with a Wake Forest teammate, Jack Jensen.\n\nSoon after the Demon Deacons were eliminated by St. Joseph\u2019s in the 1961 East Region final, reports surfaced that Jack Molinas, a Bronx native and former player with the Fort Wayne Pistons, had been fixing college games since the late 1950s by bribing players to shave points. By May, Packer had all but forgotten his hotel encounter with Markowitz. As Packer was preparing for final exams, officials from the New York Bureau of Investigation came to his room and asked him to go to the office of the university president, Harold W. Tribble.\n\nPacker was unaware that the police had been conducting surveillance near Wake Forest\u2019s hotel the night after the victory over St. John\u2019s and that officers had confused Markowitz for Molinas, who according to Packer were both about 6 feet 6 inches. What originated as a favor to a friend eventually resulted in Packer\u2019s being questioned in the office of the Manhattan district attorney Frank S. Hogan over accusations that he had been involved in shaving points.\n\nPacker said he pleaded his innocence to Tribble and McKinney, who supported him, but he flew to New York to clear his name.\n\n\u201cThey took me to Mr. Hogan\u2019s office, and I was questioned for two days there,\u201d Packer said. \u201cThey showed me pictures, all these kind of things, and there were a lot of guys that were there being questioned likewise. I said, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know nothing about this,\u2019 and held strong.\u201d\n\nAfter two days of interrogations, Packer returned to Wake Forest and talked to Tribble. There, Packer said, he finally remembered that he had sent Markowitz to Jensen\u2019s hotel room. Markowitz was eventually questioned by the police to confirm Packer\u2019s story. Soon after, Tribble released a statement publicly supporting Packer, and charges were never leveled against him.\n\nIn all, the scandal led to 37 arrests and the involvement of players on 22 campuses, including Jack Egan of St. Joseph\u2019s, a close friend of Packer\u2019s.

Rival smartphone makers using Google\u2019s Android operating system continue to challenge the company with powerful, less expensive devices.\n\nOver all, Apple sold 16 percent fewer iPhones in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Apple\u2019s best days are behind it,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. \u201cThe company grew at astronomical rates, and it\u2019s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s disappointing quarter is the latest in a string of bad reports from the biggest technology companies. While the reasons vary \u2014 including the long slump in personal computer sales and slipping prices for online ads \u2014 a common theme has been that as these companies have grown into giants, it has become harder and harder to keep up the momentum.\n\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, described the decline as a \u201cpause,\u201d not a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cThis, too, shall pass,\u201d he said in a call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThe future of Apple is very bright.\u201d\n\nBut investors were not so sure. Net income fell 22 percent to $10.5 billion, or $1.90 a share. Apple\u2019s results fell well short of Wall Street expectations, and its shares were down as much as 8 percent in after-hours trading. That wiped out about $47 billion in stock market value.\n\nSales fell faster in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, than in any other region, down 26 percent compared with the previous year. Sales in mainland China, Apple\u2019s second-largest market after the United States, fell 11 percent as the country struggled with a slowing economy. Apple\u2019s prospects there remain uncertain since the government recently shut down Apple\u2019s e-book and digital movie services without explanation.\n\nApple\u2019s forecast for the current quarter did not make Wall Street more confident. The company projected revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion. That is much worse than Wall Street had been predicting.\n\nAmit Daryanani, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that Apple may be entering a period of slowing replacement sales, similar to what happened in the personal computer market a decade ago.\n\nMr. Daryanani also noted that many companies had been hurt by the strong dollar, which makes American products more expensive overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s a common theme across technology companies,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Cook portrayed the slowdown as part of the normal two-year product cycle of Apple\u2019s iPhone. The company\u2019s larger iPhone 6 line, introduced in 2014, led to a surge in sales last year as customers upgraded, sending Apple\u2019s stock to a record high.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our installed base of iPhones today versus two years ago, it\u2019s increased 80 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nApple\u2019s stock price over the last six months.\n\nApple\u2019s newest phone, the four-inch iPhone SE, went on sale March 31 \u2014 too late to affect the second quarter\u2019s results \u2014 and Mr. Cook said that there was more demand for it than Apple could currently fill.\n\nApple has high hopes for some of its consumer-oriented services, such as Apple Music and iCloud, as well as for its nascent Watch accessory, but those have yet to turn into giant businesses. Apple said first-year sales of the Watch exceeded first-year sales of the original iPhone, but declined to provide specific figures.\n\nThe iPad tablet, once a powerful revenue generator for the company, has had disappointing sales in recent years, despite new, larger professional versions. But Mr. Cook said iPad sales would improve in the current quarter.\n\nApple still generates tens of billions of dollars of cash every year. And the company said Tuesday that it would pass along more of that money to its shareholders. Apple said it would raise its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 57 cents a share and increase the amount of stock it buys back to $175 billion.\n\nApple\u2019s services segment was one bright spot in the quarter, with revenue up 20 percent. The company ended the quarter with $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the dynamics of the iPhone business, we feel very good,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. Although unit sales were down 16 percent, \u201cwe continue to draw millions of people that are buying their first smartphone to iPhone.\u201d\n\nDenny Fish, a portfolio manager at the Janus Global Technology Fund, said Tuesday that the fund sold some of its position in Apple in the first quarter, citing the company\u2019s growth challenges and worries about its position in China.\n\nApple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to introduce other iPhones this year, which could give sales a jolt.\n\nThe company has been embroiled in a well-publicized battle with the federal government over unlocking encrypted iPhones. But Mr. Maestri said it had not seen any impact on sales, positive or negative, from the controversy.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on April 27, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: After 13 Years, Apple Revenue Finally Drops.

One of his weirdest displays of oratory \u2014 delivered this time by Mr. Blair in his role as semi-tearful revivalist preacher \u2014 was that he would \u201cheal the wounds\u201d of Africa. That was Blair the Redeemer.\n\nThen there was Blair the Efficient, who told us he would improve the educational system, transportation, hospitals: in all these areas, Britain is in a parlous state, with railway accident rates reminding us of the 19th century and true literacy levels much lower than those of the Victorians. As many as one-quarter of British parents now pay for ruinously expensive private education for the children. That is the measure of Mr. Blair\u2019s success with the schools.\n\nBeing a man of quick though skin-deep intelligence, Mr. Blair found out very quickly that there are in fact fewer and fewer areas over which British politicians, perhaps any politicians, have control in today\u2019s world.\n\nThe economy in Britain has been so successful over the last decade because politicians have at long last had so little to do with it. Our Bank of England, rather than our Treasury, has controlled the interest rates. The largely non-British City of London, most of whose firms and institutions are now in American, German or Japanese control, is the bubbling center of British wealth, and has nothing to do with Mr. Blair or his likely successor, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nTo make an impact \u2014 and there is no doubt that Mr. Blair wanted to make an impact as prime minister \u2014 he could play on only two stages: the theater of Europe as a member of the European Union, and that of the wider world as an acolyte of the United States. He quickly discovered that Europe was too amorphous for him to stand out beside the bigger players, especially beside the president of France, Jacques Chirac. It was inevitable that he would emerge as the Odd Man Out of Europe, the one who supported President Bush in his Middle Eastern adventures.\n\nSome people think he did so out of religious conviction. Maybe. Commentators make much of Mr. Blair\u2019s religion, but it has never been an issue of public importance in Britain, and it has made no obvious impact on his policies. (Abortion, the rights of gay couples to marry and adopt children, the rights of religious schools to determine their own curriculum \u2014 in all these areas the laws enacted by the Blair government have gone against the expressed views of the Roman Catholic Church, to which his wife belongs and which it is rumored he wishes to join.)\n\nIraq has been a fiasco, but I think he got involved in the calamity because, once again, he is superficial, decent and brave. The superficiality made him think it would be a quick and easy operation, like the military action in 2000 in Sierra Leone, where the British Army nipped in and out to remove a rogue warlord.\n\nAlas, his disregard for truth \u2014 indeed it seems very unlikely he even quite knows what truth is in this case \u2014 led him to think it did not matter what reason he gave for sending in the troops. You have to concede that he has been brave in his unwavering support for the war, but not so brave as the many people who have died as a result of his and President Bush\u2019s calamitous mistake.\n\nA.

Saturday brings Paul McCartney and Neil Young; Sunday, the Who and Roger Waters (whose 1960s band was Pink Floyd), and the whole lineup repeats next weekend.\n\nDesert Trip, produced by the company behind the Coachella festival and held in the same place \u2014 but with a much less strenuous schedule and setup, including reserved seats with padded chairs \u2014 is an easy target for mockery. It was immediately dubbed Oldchella for its lineup of septuagenarians performing once-startling songs that are up to half a century old, to a crowd that can look pretty creaky when trying to dance.\n\nBut on opening night of Desert Trip, far more than nostalgia was in play. Only a handful of 1960s-era musicians can still regularly draw tens of thousands of people when they tour, and they are hardly content to be oldies acts. Mr. Dylan, who was never exactly a softhearted songwriter, now openly confronts both his crumbling voice and a treacherous world, while the Rolling Stones continue, stubbornly and miraculously, to romp across stages.\n\nBoth Mr. Dylan and the Stones hold on to a 1960s spirit of improvisation; with them, no two concerts are the same. If that means some imperfection during a set \u2014 a warm-up song or two, a scrape against vocal limitations, a collision of guitar parts \u2014 that\u2019s a worthwhile price for spontaneity. On Friday night, both Mr. Dylan and the Stones had another 1960s keepsake in common, too: a deep grounding in the blues.\n\nAt first, Mr. Dylan seemed just gruffly professional. He opened his set with a longtime crowd-pleaser, \u201cRainy Day Women #12 & 35,\u201d though it had more grievance in it than the droll original, along with some changed lyrics. A full-band version of \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right\u201d made its kiss-off sound callously matter-of-fact, and Mr. Dylan rattled complacently through an upbeat \u201cIt\u2019s All Over Now, Baby Blue.\u201d\n\nBut when Mr. Dylan moved out of 1960s songs with \u201cHigh Water (For Charley Patton)\u201d \u2014 Hurricane Matthew was hitting the Southeast \u2014 his voice dug in as an apocalyptic tone entered the set and stayed there. \u201cEarly Roman Kings,\u201d a Chicago-style blues shuffle with thrusts of slide guitar, hurled brutal gangster boasts.\u201d In \u201cLovesick,\u201d the singer was betrayed and devastated; \u201cLonesome Day Blues\u201d started with roadhouse bravado before turning into an inventory of dishonor and death. \u201cPay in Blood\u201d from 2012 was a crisp, gory threat, and two of Mr. Dylan\u2019s most accusatory 1960s songs, \u201cDesolation Row\u201d and \u201cBallad of a Thin Man,\u201d were sped up but remained pitiless. His encore was a furious, unforgiving \u201cMasters of War\u201d: Mr. Dylan as moral scourge.\n\nMr. Dylan made few concessions to the festival setting, though he didn\u2019t play a set dominated by Frank Sinatra covers, as he has been on the most recent leg of his current tour. As a rule he refuses permission to be photographed, but early in his set his stage image was enlarged on video screens, the only way for much of the Desert Trip audience to see him. That ended after a half-dozen songs, and scenes from black-and-white movies replaced Mr. Dylan onscreen. Even in the video-laden 21st century, Mr. Dylan was sticking to audio.\n\nThe Rolling Stones, meanwhile, are inveterate showmen who have been working two very different acts simultaneously through the decades. One is peripatetic: Mick Jagger\u2019s stamina as he covers what must be miles of footsteps per show, roostering and gesticulating across a very wide stage with a runway into the audience \u2014 and singing nearly all the way, melodic and expressive. (Another of Mr. Jagger\u2019s jobs is patter; moments after he promised not to make age jokes, he described the festival weekend as the \u201cPalm Springs retirement home for genteel English musicians.\u201d)\n\nThe Stones\u2019 other act is a musicianly one: the band\u2019s nightly variations on its songs, with an endless cat\u2019s-cradle of exchanges between Keith Richards and Ron Wood on guitars over Charlie Watts\u2019s impeccable drums and Darryl Jones\u2019s bass. Mr. Richards usually has the gut-level rhythm parts while Mr. Wood takes the smoother high filigrees and slide-guitar wails. But there\u2019s plenty of overlapping territory where anything can happen.\n\nThe songs themselves, by Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards, are crucial. Whether or not the Stones had Oldchella in mind, Mr. Jagger opened the set singing about perseverance against the mortality: \u201cStart Me Up,\u201d \u201cYou Got Me Rocking,\u201d and the funky 1997 song \u201cOut of Control.\u201d Eventually he moved on to immortal figures like Lucifer (\u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d) and \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash.\u201d\n\nTucked into the set was a new old song: \u201cRide \u2018Em On Down,\u201d by Eddie Taylor. It\u2019s a track on \u201cBlue & Lonesome,\u201d an album due Dec. 2 that consists of a dozen Stones remakes of blues songs. A new backup singer, Sasha Allen, delivered the raspy scream in \u201cGimme Shelter.\u201d The Stones also played a Beatles song: \u201cCome Together.\u201d The sinewy riff suited Mr. Richards, though Mr. Jagger fudged some of the lyrics. Mr. McCartney, who was at the festival on Friday night, didn\u2019t seize his chance at a cameo.\n\nIt took a few songs for the Stones to align; \u201cStart Me Up\u201d had some particularly precarious moments. But soon the band was remaking its songs from within. Mr. Richards put cunning rhythmic shifts in the skeletal, syncopated doublestops of \u201cHonky Tonk Women,\u201d and his lead in \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d stabbed like a rusted switchblade. Mr. Richards and Mr. Wood brought whipsaw ups and downs to \u201cMidnight Rambler\u201d and honored the riffs of \u201cBrown Sugar\u201d while knocking them around just enough.\n\nStones songs like those have outlasted the taboos they once triggered; familiarity has replaced shock as the band\u2019s fans have grown from their youth to parent- and grandparenthood. But onstage at Oldchella, the Rolling Stones still weren\u2019t acting their age.", "summary": "Songwriters who first forged their reputations in the 1960s are the focus of this festival.", "compression": 78.1875, "coverage": 0.875, "density": 5.5, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Ecce Catholicism Inc.\n\nYes, the business of the church is saving souls, but it is nevertheless a business: a closely held conglomerate with a work force of more than a million, 1.2 billion more-or-less regular customers, 10 times as many outlets as Starbucks, more real estate than Donald Trump dreams of and lobbying clout to rival that of any secular industry. Now its C.E.O., physically and mentally depleted at age 85, is stepping down, creating an opportunity for a serious relaunch.\n\nCatholicism is mostly a service industry \u2014 Canyon Ranch for the spirit, if you will \u2014 and its deliverables have stood the test of millenniums: instruction in how to live a good life, sacraments to consecrate major milestones, comfort in times of distress, the cleansing therapy of confession, penance and absolution, a sense of place in the universal order and the promise of a celestial payoff. The fundamental problems are not in the catalog. There is still a robust market for the faith. The problem \u2014 evident in the waning confidence of the customers as well as the rising market share of evangelical start-ups and none of the above \u2014 is with the management.\n\nAs we wait for the ecclesiastical board of directors to fill the Chair of St. Peter, I\u2019ve been asking professional consultants, including some who work with the church, what Catholicism Inc. might learn from the temporal business world. After all, while the church adapts at a glacial pace, it does adapt. The church\u2019s teachings have evolved not just on the liturgy but also on issues as fraught as priestly celibacy, slavery, money-lending, war and peace, wealth and poverty, divorce and the role of women; even that most divisive of issues, abortion, was not always defined as strictly as it is now.\n\nFor starters, my experts generally agree, it would help to have a pope with the drive and charisma to reboot the mission, someone with the gift of persuasion, a bit of media savvy and enough years ahead of him to follow through. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it all about age, but wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have somebody who was closer to 60 than to 80?\u201d said a consultant who has helped reverse the fortunes of a major airline and a global fast-food chain. (Like some of my experts, he preferred to speak on background.) Pope John Paul II became pope at age 58, and before his papacy sank into scandal and Parkinson\u2019s, he was a beloved, globe-trotting dynamo. Benedict XVI was 78 at the start, and he felt a bit like a caretaker.\n\nThe first major task facing Benedict\u2019s successor will be to get past the lingering horror story of predatory priests, to restore the trust of the faithful and the respect of the general public. The business world has much to teach about surviving scandal. Michael Useem, director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at the Wharton School, told me the church might learn from the way Warren Buffett cleaned up Salomon Brothers after a bond-trading scandal and Ed Breen revived Tyco International after its chief executive went to prison for theft. The remedies were bold and effective. First, a purge of those responsible for the abuses and the cover-up. (\u201cManaging out,\u201d as it is called in the corporate vernacular, has been a major weakness in the church, so it was heartening to hear the Vatican spokesman say that Benedict\u2019s retirement could \u201copen the door for a potential wave of resignations.\u201d) Second, unstinting disclosure to investigators, waiving any privileges. Third, appointment of a compliance officer with impeccable credentials, ethical tenacity and conspicuous support at the top. At Tyco, the new leadership went on a high-profile road show of the company\u2019s outposts to drive home the reforms.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d Useem said, \u201cif the new pope went on a tour, and at every stop he met with the local clergy and said: \u2018It\u2019s a new church. We\u2019ve been at it for a couple thousand years, and at this point we need to uphold the principles we all hold dear, and here are my 10 steps for making that happen.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOnce the new pope has dealt with the legacy of past disgrace, it will be time to look ahead. Ted Stenger, a corporate turnaround expert at the consulting firm AlixPartners and a devoted Catholic, pointed out that most big companies assemble their executives every few years for an intensive strategic review. The last time the church took stock was the Second Vatican Council, half a century ago. \u201cThe mission of the church is not going to change,\u201d Stenger said. \u201cBut how you set objectives and tactics to deliver on the mission may in fact change.\u201d", "summary": "The church is a troubled business.

The wisdom and the skill on the page are apparent, and all too rare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a 65-page book proposal obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Lehrer described the day last summer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuggy Sunday morning in St. Louis\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when his journalistic fraud was discovered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel the shiver of a voice mail message,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote in the proposal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Book About Love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI listen to the message. I have been found out. I puke into a recycling bin. And then I start to cry. Why was I crying? I had been caught in a lie, a desperate attempt to conceal my mistakes. And now it was clear that, within 24 hours, my fall would begin. I would lose my job and my reputation. My private shame would become public.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Lehrer, then a 31-year-old wunderkind of the journalism and publishing worlds, had fabricated quotes from Bob Dylan and recycled his own work from one publication to another, and he subsequently lost his prestigious position at The New Yorker. His publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, quickly removed print copies of his best-selling book \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine: How Creativity Works\u00e2\u0080\u009d from bookshelves and from online retailers.\n\nSince then, Mr. Lehrer has remained mostly quiet, appearing onstage in February at a seminar sponsored by the Knight Foundation. (The foundation, whose stated mission includes supporting \u00e2\u0080\u009cquality journalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d later apologized for paying him an eye-popping $20,000 speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fee.)\n\nLiberally quoting from Jane Austen, Philip Larkin, Shakespeare, Erasmus, Darwin and Sartre (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHell is other people\u00e2\u0080\u009d), Mr. Lehrer outlines a book with a style that resembles the pop-science titles that helped make him famous: \u00e2\u0080\u009cImagine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow We Decide\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cProust Was a Neuroscientist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCareers fall apart; homes fall down; we give away what we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want and sell what we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet, if we are lucky, such losses reveal what remains. When we are stripped of what we wanted, we see what we will always need: those people who love us, even after the fall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the cover page of the heavily footnoted proposal, the book is described as 80,000 words long. The manuscript will be delivered in November 2014, the proposal says.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis book is about what has lasted in my own life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to write it down so that I would not forget; so that, one day, I might tell my young daughter what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned anything from writing these words, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that love matters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote in the proposal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coda. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt matters more than I ever thought possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe proposal was sent to publishers by the Wylie Agency, Mr. Lehrer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s literary representatives. When reached for comment, Andrew Wylie said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will talk to you if you tell me where you got the proposal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Told that The Times does not discuss sourcing, he declined to comment further.\n\nThe journalist Michael Moynihan discovered Mr. Lehrer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fabrications of Dylan quotes in an article published in Tablet magazine last year. After initially denying any wrongdoing, Mr. Lehrer eventually released a statement of apology through his publisher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lies are over now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand the gravity of my position. I want to apologize to everyone I have let down, especially my editors and readers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do my best to correct the record and ensure that my misquotations and mistakes are fixed. I have resigned my position as staff writer at The New Yorker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBrowbeat, Slate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture blog, reported on Tuesday that Mr. Lehrer was circulating a book.\n\nIn the proposal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introduction, Mr. Lehrer describes leaving St. Louis, his \u00e2\u0080\u009csuit and shirt stained with sweat and vomit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and returning home.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI open the front door and take off my dirty shirt and weep on the shoulder of my wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy wife is caring but confused: How the hell could I be so reckless? I have no good answers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLori Glazer, a spokeswoman for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, said the publisher had not received the proposal. Asked if her company would consider publishing Mr. Lehrer again, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a higher bar to clear because of everything we found in the previous two books, but we would never prejudge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "summary": "Jonah Lehrer will use his plagiarism scandal as a case study in a book about the redemptive power of love.", "compression": 44.7142857143, "coverage": 0.8095238095, "density": 2.2380952381, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

KLEINMAY 13, 2014\n\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 Henrik Lundqvist, the king of Game 7s, stood tall again for the Rangers on Tuesday night. He stopped 35 of 36 Penguins shots \u2014 even a couple without his stick in a chaotic goal-mouth scramble in the final minutes \u2014 to spearhead a thrilling 2-1 victory that capped a historic comeback from a three-games-to-one series deficit.\n\nWhen the final horn blared and the Rangers were on their way to their second appearance in the Eastern Conference finals in the past three years, Lundqvist leapt into the air, thrust his arms to the sky and was enveloped by a mob of jubilant teammates.\n\n\u201cIt was such a good feeling at the end, when you know it\u2019s a done deal, and we did it,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cWe came back.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in their 88-year history, the Rangers won a playoff series after falling behind, 3-1. But winning Game 7s has become a Rangers specialty. This was the second time they did so this postseason (they vanquished the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round) and their fifth in a row since 2012. Four of those victories were by 2-1 scores.\n\nThis Game 7, however, was special. It capped a comeback in which the Rangers overcame the toughest playoff schedule any N.H.L. team had played in 25 years, including a stretch of five games in seven nights.\n\nAnd as every Ranger who spoke afterward pointed out, it was one in which the team rallied around Martin St. Louis, whose mother died last Thursday, before Game 5.\n\n\u201cI know she was with me the whole way,\u201d St. Louis said. \u201cThe passing of my mom puts everything in perspective. I think we rallied from that situation, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud \u2014 I said it before \u2014 to be a New York Ranger. The boys have really embraced my situation and supported me. They really pushed for one another. I can\u2019t believe it. We came back, one game at a time.\u201d\n\nLundqvist ran his Game 7 record to 5-1 \u2014 5-0 in his last five; his only loss was in 2009, against the Washington Capitals \u2014 and his save percentage in Game 7s rose to an astonishing .965.\n\nHe repeatedly turned away the Pittsburgh riflemen \u2014 especially Chris Kunitz and Evgeni Malkin. The saves of the night came late in the third period, when Lundqvist somehow stopped a goal-mouth shot by Paul Martin that deflected off a lost stick lying right in front of him after he himself had lost his stick making two saves during the Penguins\u2019 furious scramble.\n\n\u201cThose saves with five minutes to go, three or four in a row \u2014 those were the biggest saves I\u2019ve seen him make since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Marc Staal said. \u201cUp one goal with five minutes left, and we needed a big save there, and he made a bunch.\u201d\n\nIf Lundqvist led the way, a Rangers team experienced in winning Game 7s followed in close support. The cumulative Game 7 record of the Rangers who skated Tuesday was 61-6, while that of the Penguins was 23-18.\n\nBrad Richards scored the tiebreaking goal on a second-period power play, set up by St. Louis. Richards\u2019s personal record in Game 7s is 7-0.\n\n\u201cIt breeds good feelings, good karma \u2014 you think good things because you\u2019ve already seen them,\u201d Richards said of the positive Game 7 experiences. \u201cWhen you\u2019re sitting in the afternoon today thinking, you picture good things happening, because that\u2019s what you know.\n\n\u201cThis group has been unbelievably resilient,\u201d he added. \u201cGame 7s every year, two conference finals in three years, and never backing in. It\u2019s been a war every time.\u201d\n\nBrian Boyle opened the scoring at 5 minutes 25 seconds of the first period by completing a great passing play with his fourth-line mates, Dominic Moore and Derek Dorsett. The goal quieted what had been a clamorous crowd at Consol Energy Center.\n\nDorsett, who played only 3:43 in Game 6 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden, started a rush down the ice and found Boyle streaking into the Penguins\u2019 zone. Boyle tapped the puck between his legs back to Moore, who waited a moment before returning it to Boyle, who directed it past Marc-Andre Fleury (18 saves).\n\nBoyle had entered the game at minus 5, the worst team mark in the series. Dorsett had not recorded a point in 11 previous playoff games. Moore came into the game at minus 4, but his assist was his third point in three career Game 7s against the Penguins.\n\nIn the second period, Jussi Jokinen re-energized the Pittsburgh fans by tying the score at 4:15. But Richards scored 3:41 later, only the third power-play goal of the series for the Rangers.\n\n\u201cOur power play\u2019s been the talk of the first two rounds,\u201d St. Louis said. \u201cTonight, a power-play goal was the difference. So you persevere, you try to be part of the solution, and we did that tonight.\u201d\n\nAt the end, St. Louis led the Rangers\u2019 handshake line. Gracious in defeat, the Penguins expressed their condolences to him for the loss of his mother.\n\nWhile the Rangers celebrated reaching the next round against Boston or Montreal, the Penguins mourned their fifth straight postseason collapse since they won the Stanley Cup in 2009.\n\nSidney Crosby, the regular-season scoring champion, went minus 1 and was held off the score sheet for a third straight game. He had a particularly difficult time, fanning on a backhand with an open net yawning before him, and twice handling the puck right off the end of his stick while breaking into the Rangers\u2019 zone.\n\nThe loss put the future of this glamorous but ultimately disappointing Penguins team very much in doubt, especially the statuses of Coach Dan Bylsma and Fleury.\n\nThe defeat also raised the possibility that Malkin, a former N.H.L. most valuable player, might be traded for a lockdown defenseman who might protect the kind of series lead the Penguins frittered away against the Rangers.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to win the Stanley Cup, and we haven\u2019t done that in five seasons,\u201d Bylsma said. \u201cI\u2019m 20 minutes post battling for a Game 7, and right to the bitter end. I haven\u2019t contemplated the price that it\u2019s going to be, or anything toward the future yet.\u201d\n\nCrosby said, \u201cWe worked hard but didn\u2019t find a way to win.\u201d He then acknowledged Lundqvist.\n\n\u201cHe made some big saves,\u201d he said.\n\nSt. Louis referred to Lundqvist from a different perspective, but one that reflected similar awe.\n\n\u201cHe played like that nickname he carried,\u201d St. Louis said. \u201cThe king.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 14, 2014, on page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: At Their Best on the Brink.

Historically, that\u2019s quite an achievement. Even Ed Koch, the man who helped put a stake in the heart of Tammany Hall in the early 1960s, had the tacit backing of machines in Brooklyn and the Bronx when he captured the mayoralty in 1977.\n\nPolitical machines clearly aren\u2019t what they used to be. But last fall\u2019s designation of the old Tammany Hall headquarters on Union Square as a city landmark is a reminder of just how powerful the nation\u2019s most famous machine was, and why it remains a presence in political conversations.\n\nTammany Hall \u2014 shorthand for the faction that controlled Manhattan\u2019s Democratic Party for most of a 150-year period \u2014 has a well-deserved place in the annals of urban misgovernment in the United States. It stole elections, it intimidated political antagonists, and it shook down contractors and vendors. It produced the very face of political corruption, William M. Tweed, known to friend and foe as \u201cBoss.\u201d And it was at best indifferent to the grievances of African-Americans and, later, Hispanics in New York.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to the story. Tammany Hall\u2019s leaders delivered social services at a time when City Hall and Albany did not. They massaged justice at a time when the poor did not have access to public defenders. And they found jobs for the unemployed when the alternative was hunger and illness.\n\nBarbara Porges, a Tammany district leader years before women won the right to vote, prided herself on knowing the names and predicaments of peddlers who worked on Orchard Street in the heart of her district. When one of them, an onion seller, contracted tuberculosis, Ms. Porges raised money to send him to a drier climate. Nobody saw reason to ask how this was achieved.\n\nFor generations of immigrants and their children in Manhattan, the face of government was the face of the local Tammany ward heeler. And it was a friendly face. This was something entirely new for Russian Jews, Southern Italians and, to be sure, the Irish who dominated the machine. Their experience with politics in the old country was not quite so amiable.\n\nFor Tammany, power rested on voter turnout. And turnout was a function of relentless outreach and tireless service. The legendary Tammany leader George Washington Plunkitt \u2014 the man who coined the phrase \u201chonest graft\u201d \u2014 met with constituents and lesser Tammany officials in his district several times a week to find out who was happy with Tammany\u2019s services and who required some special attention.\n\nAnother notable Tammany district leader who worked his way up from poverty, Jeremiah T. Mahoney, once insisted that he and other Tammany colleagues never forgot the dire circumstances of their impoverished childhoods amid the splendor of late 19th-century Manhattan. Those memories, he argued, led Tammany to support progressive reforms like workers\u2019 compensation, the beginning of minimum-wage laws, the federal income tax, public pensions for widows and children, greater government regulation of the workplace and private property, and other laws that helped set the stage for the New Deal in the 1930s. The Tammany machine\u2019s two greatest advocates for social reform were Mahoney\u2019s law partner, Senator Robert F. Wagner, and the four-time governor Alfred E. Smith.\n\nAt the same time, Tammany resisted the reform movement\u2019s impulse to impose an evangelical Anglo-Protestant morality on the Catholics and Jews who made up the bulk of New York\u2019s poor. Many private charities in the early 20th century were obsessed with dividing the poor into those considered worthy of help and those whose personal lives disqualified them for assistance.\n\nTammany figures, many of them descended from survivors of the potato famine in the mid-19th century, made no attempt to investigate the claims of those who sought their help. One of the machine\u2019s legendary scoundrels, \u201cBig Tim\u201d Sullivan, explained how he approached those who sought a free meal in his clubhouse: \u201cI never ask a hungry man about his past. I feed him not because he is good, but because he needs food.\u201d\n\nYes, many Tammany figures, including Sullivan, were corrupt. But it\u2019s hard not to detect more than a little bigotry in the rhetoric of the machine\u2019s foes. Andrew D. White, president of Cornell University and one of the late 19th century\u2019s most-celebrated reformers, once complained that under Tammany and its imitators, a \u201ccrowd of illiterate peasants, freshly raked from Irish bogs, or Bohemian mines, or Italian robber nests,\u201d exercised \u201cvirtual control\u201d over New York and other cities packed with immigrants.\n\nIndeed they did, thanks to Tammany\u2019s embrace of an early form of multiculturalism. Tammany\u2019s Irish leaders were quick to incorporate Jews into their clubhouses (Herbert Lehman, the first Jew elected governor of New York, was vice chairman of Tammany\u2019s finance committee in the mid-1920s), and while it was hardly ahead of its times on race relations, it encouraged black participation at a time when fellow Democrats in the South suppressed voting rights.\n\nTammany Hall certainly was guilty of many of the offenses arraigned against it. But those flaws should not overshadow Tammany\u2019s undoubted virtues. The machine succeeded not simply because it could round up votes.

Now, they would pay ordinary income tax rates, as much as 39.6 percent, on everything.\n\nIn any event, none of this would start until 2011, which gives the economy a chance to recover and taxpayers time to estimate the impact on themselves.\n\nThe budget proposal also contains new or improved tax breaks for low-income workers, college students and millions who earn less than $65,000 and want to save more for retirement. Besides taxes, there are education and health programs in the new budget that will benefit people with low and moderate incomes.\n\nNot all of these measures will survive the Congressional haggling process. This week\u2019s proposals are probably the worst case for high-income people.\n\nBut it sure looks as though some wealthy people will pay more. Whether it\u2019s more than their fair share is a debate for the ages. Since they are bearing the brunt of the changes, however, we\u2019ll detail the ones that affect them.\n\nThe top two federal income tax brackets would rise to 36 percent and 39.6 percent from 33 percent and 35 percent, respectively. This would affect married couples who earn more than $250,000 in gross income, and singles who earn more than $200,000, according to Mr. Stretch of Deloitte.\n\nUpper-income people will also find that their income tax deductions are not worth as much. Most families in the top two tax brackets itemize tax deductions. Mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable contributions and state income taxes are some of the most popular deductions.\n\nUnder the proposed budget, however, taxpayers will get less in deductions. Currently, the benefit of itemizing increases as you move up the income ladder. For someone in the existing 35 percent tax bracket, $10,000 in itemized deductions would reduce a tax bill by $3,500. But the Obama plan would limit that deduction to 28 percent, cutting tax liability by only $2,800.\n\nHere\u2019s what would happen to a married couple in New York with two children under the age of 17, a $300,000 household income and itemized deductions of $75,000 ($36,000 in mortgage interest, $6,000 in charitable contributions, $18,000 in state income taxes and $15,000 in property taxes).\n\nUnder the current tax system, they would owe $56,400 in federal taxes, which is the amount they pay because their circumstances force them to pay the alternative minimum tax. Higher-income individuals generally need to run two calculations when they are doing their federal taxes, one under the regular tax system and another using the A.M.T. The A.M.T. does not allow several deductions like property taxes and state income taxes. Taxpayers pay whichever bill is higher.\n\nThe couple\u2019s total federal tax bill under the existing, regular tax system would have been $48,300, $8,100 less than the A.M.T. tax due. That difference would shrink to $5,800 under President Obama\u2019s system, according to Deloitte. That would not be enough to push the family out of A.M.T. territory. Thus, they\u2019d still owe the same $56,400.\n\nBut if their income rose, that difference would shrink to zero, and the A.M.T. amount would then become less than the regular income tax. \u201cAt some point, you have enough income and small enough deductions that all of the Obama changes would hurt,\u201d Mr. Stretch said.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, 27 percent of households earning more than $200,000 annually live in the Northeast and 25 percent live on the West Coast, both prime areas for the A.M.T.\n\nPeople in the top two brackets would also pay more in taxes on their investments. The rate paid on capital gains and qualified dividends would rise to 20 percent from 15 percent (middle income families, or those in the 25 percent and 28 percent tax brackets, would still pay 15 percent).\n\nThe budget would make permanent the \u201cMaking Work Pay\u201d tax cut, which was passed as part of the Recovery Act for 2009 and 2010. This provision provides a refundable tax credit of up to $400 for working individuals and $800 for married couples filing their tax returns jointly.\n\nThe credit begins to phase out at income levels of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nSince the credit is \u201crefundable,\u201d you\u2019ll get money back even if you have no federal income-tax liability. The credit will be distributed by reducing the amount of taxes deducted from your paycheck for Social Security and Medicare.\n\nCatherine Rampell and Amanda Cox contributed reporting.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Braced for a Higher Tax Bill, Some May Dodge the Bullet.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain vital relations with the government, said that nobody appeared to be in charge at the agency, known as the \u201cemergency operations center,\u201d and that different factions made decisions independently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only body responsible,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhat is it doing?\u201d\n\nIn the case of the shipping container, the desperately needed supplies seem to have been caught, at least in part, in a trap that is common the world over: politics, money and power.\n\nThe supplies were donated by individuals and institutions in the United States, according to Chernoh Alpha Bah, who organized the shipment. But Mr. Bah wears another hat, as well. He is an opposition politician from President Ernest Bai Koroma\u2019s hometown, Makeni \u2014 a place that clearly showed the government\u2019s inability to contain Ebola.\n\nA recent surge of cases there quickly overwhelmed health workers, with protective gear so lacking that some nurses have worked around the deadly virus in their street clothes.\n\nMore than 80 health care workers in Sierra Leone have died in the outbreak, and even in the capital, Freetown, some burial crews wear protective gowns with gaping holes in them, a clear indication of the urgent need for more supplies.\n\nThe government official who pleaded for the shipment to come in said that the political tensions may have contributed to the delay, to prevent the opposition from trumpeting the donations.\n\nMr. Bah said he thought the equipment would be welcomed by the struggling authorities, and he said he expected the shipping fee of $6,500 would be a small detail for Sierra Leone. According to the official, the government has already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola.\n\nThe shipping company, as a good-will gesture in a moment of crisis, had agreed to send the goods without being paid first, Mr. Bah said. But no more. Three other containers of similar value await shipment from the United States, he said, halted by the government\u2019s long refusal to pay.\n\n\u201cWe will appreciate if the payment is made quickly so that the medical supplies will be sent directly to the affected or targeted areas,\u201d Mr. Bah wrote to the government on Aug. 16.\n\nInstead, top government officials argued over the fee, said that the proper procedures had not been followed, and finally brushed aside the official urging that the supplies be let in, saying they wanted to hear nothing more about it.\n\n\u201cThey are blaming us for shipping in without authorization,\u201d Mr. Bah said. \u201cIt appears all they are interested in is cash donations. And all we have are supplies.\u201d\n\nAt one point, a senior official close to the president, Sylvia Olayinka Blyden, acknowledged in an email that the items listed in Mr. Bah\u2019s container were \u201cvery impressive.\u201d But she said \u201cfuture shipments\u201d should follow procedure. That was on Sept. 1, and she has since left her post. The goods are still inside the container on the dock here.\n\n\u201cHe should have contacted the ministry and discussed it with the ministry,\u201d Yayah A. Conteh, an official at the health ministry, said of Mr. Bah, adding that the medical supplies would be cleared \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nIn times of crisis, when needs are great and officials are overburdened, trickles of uncoordinated donations can be a distraction, some aid workers say, requiring a lot of attention without solving the biggest problems.\n\nBut some Sierra Leoneans say that the government\u2019s resistance has discouraged other potential donors in the diaspora.\n\nIbrahim Kamara, a Sierra Leonean in Canada who has put together what he says is a $55,000 container of medical supplies, said that he was now encountering the same problems with the government \u2014 an unwillingness to pay the $5,000 shipping fee.\n\n\u201cThere is no positive response, no feedback, no anything,\u201d Mr. Kamara said. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a month now.\u201d\n\nThe emergency operations center was established to manage the urgent but confusing patchwork of agencies and international aid groups trying to battle the virus. The health ministry itself has been rocked by corruption and mismanagement scandals in recent years, further weakening efforts in a country that, even before the Ebola epidemic, suffered from some of the world\u2019s worst health statistics after a brutal 10-year civil war.\n\nTwenty-nine of the country\u2019s top health officials were indicted last year in connection with the misappropriation of a half-million dollars in vaccination funds. The leaders were all acquitted. A free health care program set up by foreign donors has been damaged by corruption problems, with nurses illegally selling drugs and doctors charging for services. In 2010, a former health minister was convicted on corruption charges. This year, the health minister was pushed aside during the Ebola crisis amid questions over her competence.\n\nAt a recent meeting at the emergency operations center, local politicians discussed at length how they might be able to use the government\u2019s recent three-day national lockdown \u2014 in which volunteers went door-to-door to educate people about Ebola \u2014 for their own political benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, reported cases of Ebola are doubling every 30 to 40 days, according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 620 deaths have been recorded, with the real number almost certainly much higher.\n\nThe government official who pleaded for the supplies to be let in argued that the epidemic, \u201clike the war we experienced between 1991 and 2002,\u201d had exposed the extent of government corruption.\n\nThe more urgent the pleas, the official said, the more it \u201celicited only disdain from some people in authority.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on October 6, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Help Nearby, but Delayed on the Docks.

The lower house of Parliament is set to enter negotiations with representatives of individual E.U. members to rewrite the bloc\u2019s privacy regulations, which date to 1995.\n\nMr. Albrecht\u2019s proposal on Wednesday was quickly condemned by the technology industry.\n\nA coalition of U.S., Asian and European businesses and advertisers criticized the plan, which would give Europeans much stronger legal protections to control their online identities than people elsewhere.\n\nThe ad hoc group, called the Industry Coalition for Data Protection, said the proposal would stifle the Web economy in Europe by undermining the ad-driven financing that makes possible most of the free, popular Web sites on the Internet.\n\nThe group, which includes the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union, said Mr. Albrecht\u2019s recommendation, compiled after nearly a year of parliamentary hearings on the issue, did not take into account concerns expressed by industry.\n\nThe draft report \u201cmissed an opportunity to reconcile effective privacy safeguards with rules protecting the conduct of business \u2014 both fundamental rights under the E.U. charter,\u201d the group said.\n\nMr. Albrecht, a member of the Green Party from Hamburg, said during an interview that he had gone out of his way to address business concerns by relaxing paperwork and other administrative burdens proposed by Ms. Reding.\n\n\u201cWhat you are seeing here is a gut reaction from the industry group,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Albrecht\u2019s proposal would replace Europe\u2019s existing privacy panel, an advisory group of regulators to the commission called the Article 29 Working Party, with what would in effect be the power to set technical standards for the Web advertising industry, said Kimon Zorbas, a vice president in Brussels at IAB Europe, an association that represents Internet advertisers, marketers and analytics firms.\n\nMr. Zorbas said Mr. Albrecht\u2019s proposal would impose unrealistic demands on companies to obtain prior consent from consumers, and to respond to millions of individual complaints, before collecting even simple, anonymous forms of Web data critical to the industry.\n\n\u201cThis proposal is much stricter than the already challenging proposal we received last year from the European Commission,\u201d Mr. Zorbas said. \u201cThere are a lot of dramatic things being proposed here that would have significant, damaging effects on industry.\u201d\n\nThe full Parliament is expected to vote on the proposal in April, and a final agreement with the upper house is not expected until later this year.\n\nThe E.U. justice ministers, who are acting as the upper legislative chamber on the data protection legislation, are preparing to begin their own deliberations on the proposals under the guidance of Alan Shatter, the Irish justice minister. They will meet in Dublin on Jan. 18 to discuss the issue.\n\nMr. Shatter, through a spokeswoman, Anita Toolan, said obtaining a political agreement on the outlines of the legislation was a priority for Ireland, which holds the Union\u2019s rotating presidency through June.\n\n\u201cSubstantial resources are being devoted to reach political agreement on key aspects of the package,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the key issues \u2014 prior consent, a so-called right to be forgotten and fines on violators \u2014 are thorny, and agreement is not ensured. While some countries, like Germany, favor strict privacy laws and are supportive, others, like Ireland and Britain, tend to be more sensitive to business concerns.", "summary": "If approved, the proposal would replace an advisory panel with an agency with the power to levy fines on companies who violate rules on the use of information gathered online.", "compression": 29.09375, "coverage": 0.9375, "density": 4.375, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Armed with a canny resourcefulness \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not to mention an ample bosom she aims at the world like guns defending a fortified bunker \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Celeste will make her way forward as she always has, with a hearty laugh and no backward glances. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck at the bottom of the barrel, her thinking might go, you may as well have a high old time rolling around in it.\n\nThere is something pleasingly fitting in having Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exotically named, fringe-dwelling characters played by two performers who themselves have floridly funny names and who have made their careers largely on the outer margins of show business: Penny Arcade in the New York performance art scene, Mink Stole as a contract player in the informal movie studio run by the renegade John Waters.\n\nMy fears that this would prove to be an unprofitable bit of stunt casting quickly evaporated once the director Cosmin Chivu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production roared into life, with the happily tooting horns of a live Dixieland jazz band. Neither actress has much experience in traditional theater, but these two inhabit the scarred souls of their contrasting characters with an intuitive confidence, bringing these comic grotesques to scabrously funny life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Mutilated\u00e2\u0080\u009d was widely reviled when it was first produced (unfathomably) on Broadway in 1966, along with Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s play \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Gn\u00c3\u00a4diges Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a double bill called \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlapstick Tragedy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It closed just seven performances after opening, one in a string of flops that marked the later, grim stages of Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career.\n\nStylistically, Williams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expressionistic late plays have little in common with the fundamentally naturalistic dramas that made his reputation. But as this scrappy revival proves, when handled with funky exuberance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Mutilated\u00e2\u0080\u009d can cast a spell. Williams here treats in a burlesque manner some of the same themes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the sad, solitary nature of life, the cruelty that vulnerability can paradoxically inspire \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that he explores in more delicate hues elsewhere.\n\nThe tattered wafer of plot concerns Celeste\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dogged attempts to worm her way back into the good graces of the comfortably moneyed Trinket, on whose kindness she has depended for some time. Like an injured animal that has crawled into a dark hole to lick its wounds, Trinket has ensconced herself in a seedy hotel in New Orleans, consorting with the vulgar likes of Celeste, from a feeling of harrowing shame; she has never emotionally recovered from losing a breast to cancer. Although Celeste has sworn never to reveal this secret, she is not above using it to blackmail her friend.\n\nDressed in a flashy floral dress that suggests a sausage casing in a pattern by Arcimboldo, with her marcelled red hair beginning to come un-marcelled, Celeste sneaks around after Trinket like a mangy cat on the trail of a mouse. Although she maliciously threatens to broadcast her secret to the world and throws a cranky tantrum when all her efforts seem to be going nowhere, Celeste nevertheless possesses a big-hearted humanity that makes her impossible to dislike. Her appetites are what keep her going (\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs long as you have longings, satisfaction is possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she philosophizes), and Penny Arcade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big, bold performance radiates a lusty hunger that perfectly captures the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essence.\n\nMink Stole is equally fine as the more genteel Trinket. Keeping her arm curled upward reflexively, to camouflage what she sees as the glaring fact of her \u00e2\u0080\u009cmutilation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trinket treads gingerly through the seamy French Quarter streets, trailing an air of apology. Her frightened eyes search like floodlights for an answering compassion, but when, in desperation for company, she picks up a sailor, Trinket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fluttery attempts at drawing him out bring only humiliation. The actress invests this embattled, fragile woman with a moving dignity.\n\nAlthough the supporting performances are uneven, the effect is negligible, since the war of wills between Trinket and Celeste dominates the play, which is performed on a colorfully skeletal set by Anka Lupes and features excellent jazz music by Jesse Selengut. (Williams wrote a series of crackpot pseudo-Christmas carols to fill in scene changes.)\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never really any question as to who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to come out on top in this battle of wills; Trinket is no match for the indomitable Celeste. In the desperate, darkling world of this macabre comedy, shame, betrayal and poverty can be endured.

Thompson, co-founder and C.E.O. of Proteus, a biomedical company based in Redwood City, Calif., was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.\n\nAndrew M. Thompson, co-founder and C.E.O. of Proteus, a biomedical company, says people shouldn't try to concoct motivations for another's behavior. \"It's like in tennis or volleyball, and you have to stay on your side of the net,\" he says.\n\nEvery Sunday, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about the challenges of leading and managing. In his new book, \"The Corner Office\" (Times Books), he analyzes the broader lessons that emerge from his interviews with more than 70 leaders. Excerpt \u00c2\u00bb\n\nQ. Can you talk about how to create an innovative culture?\n\nA. I\u2019ve been an entrepreneur for 22 years in Silicon Valley, so that essentially creates a life that\u2019s defined by doing things that are innovative and different. When you build a company or organization that\u2019s going to take on those kinds of challenges, I think there are two things that are really important.\n\nOne is that you reward innovative and new things in ways that are very obvious and are very visible \u2014 it\u2019s the culture of what you talk about, what you celebrate, what you reward, what you make visible. For example, in this company, which is very heavily driven by intellectual property, if you file a patent or have your name on a patent, we give you a little foam brain.\n\nBut then, more important, right in our front lobby, there are shelves of big glass jars and everyone\u2019s name in the company is on one of them \u2014 they\u2019re like an apothecary jar. And that\u2019s where your brains go. And so we have this huge wall that\u2019s full of brains.\n\nThere\u2019s no money in it. We don\u2019t pay people to file patents because we\u2019re an innovative company. That\u2019s part of your job. But we recognize it and we make it extremely visible. Everyone who walks in the front door just looks and says \u201cwow.\u201d That\u2019s a very specific and extremely powerful way that we promote and reward innovation.\n\nBut there\u2019s another thing that I think is probably a little less obvious: in the context of being an innovative company, it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t penalize failure. In an innovative company, and particularly for a start-up company, you have to take risk. So you have to have a very strong bias to action over analytics, and for learning from mistakes and moving forward.\n\nThat\u2019s very much what I call a leadership culture as opposed to a management culture, and it\u2019s very counterintuitive to many people who come from large organizations where failure is absolutely clobbered. I want to be clear about this: It\u2019s not that you reward failure. You don\u2019t penalize it. What you focus on much more is risk-taking and a bias to action. So the real sin in a small company is not making a mistake, it\u2019s not moving. That doesn\u2019t always mean you move in the right direction. But if you discover you\u2019re moving in the wrong direction, you change direction. It\u2019s fairly easy to see and to reward people who have those instincts.\n\nQ. Tell me more about that.\n\nA. In our company, at the senior team level, we talk about everybody in the company twice a year in a very structured way, where we spend several hours identifying people who we think are our golden seed. These are people who have very strong leadership instincts, who understand how to move the ball forward. They know how to take risks, and how to either build on work that\u2019s successful, or they are able to say that something doesn\u2019t work, and let\u2019s move on, let\u2019s change that. And those people we try to promote quickly.\n\nQ. How do you reinforce this in the culture of your company more broadly?\n\nA. If we have something we want to celebrate or talk about \u2014 let\u2019s say we promote someone or want to recognize someone, for example \u2014 we\u2019ll talk about it in a meeting. A big part of building a culture is around stories, right? So the stories have to be real, and they have to be vivid. If you\u2019ve got someone who\u2019s an effective risk taker, you make that very clear and you tell the story. You want these things to become legends.\n\nQ. What are some other things you do?\n\nA. Culture in our company is a really big deal, and we have a values system built around quality, teamwork and leadership. One of the activities around that cultural framework is the idea that employees can recognize each other \u2014 groups or teams can recognize or be recognized by other employees for doing things that specifically demonstrate those values.", "summary": "Andrew M.

Even that rate, about 1 percent, has been climbing rapidly in recent years \u2014 from 0.6 percent in the United States in 2007, for example.\n\nBut experts said the findings did not mean that the actual numbers of children with autism were rising, simply that the study was more comprehensive than previous ones.\n\n\u201cThis is a very impressive study,\u201d said Lisa Croen, director of the autism research program at Kaiser-Permanente Northern California, who was not connected with the new report. \u201cThey did a careful job and in a part of the world where autism has not been well documented in the past.\u201d\n\nFor the study, which is being published in The American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers from the Yale Child Study Center, George Washington University and other leading institutions sought to screen every child aged 7 to 12 in Ilsan, a community of 488,590, about the size of Staten Island.\n\nBy contrast, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and most other research groups measure autism prevalence by examining and verifying records of existing cases kept by health care and special education agencies. That approach may leave out many children whose parents and schools have never sought a diagnosis.\n\nIn recent years scientists have come to see autism as a spectrum of disorders that can include profound social disconnection and mental retardation, but also milder forms, like Asperger\u2019s syndrome, that are pervasive and potentially disabling but that often go undiagnosed.\n\n\u201cFrom the get-go we had the feeling that we would find a higher prevalence than other studies because we were looking at an understudied population: children in regular schools,\u201d said the lead researcher, Dr. Young-Shin Kim, a child psychiatrist and epidemiologist at the Yale Child Study Center.\n\nSouth Korea was chosen not only because autism prevalence had not been measured there, but also because its national health care system, universal education and homogeneous population made it a promising region for a planned series of studies that will also look at genetic and environmental factors in autism.\n\nThe study, which was largely financed by the research and advocacy group Autism Speaks, raises the question of whether a similarly high prevalence would be found in the United States if all children were screened.\n\nDr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, chief of developmental disabilities at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the C.D.C., acknowledged that her agency\u2019s records-based approach probably missed some autistic children \u2014 especially among the poor, among racial minorities and \u201cpotentially among girls\u201d \u2014 and said the agency was interested in taking part in a population-based approach like the Korean study.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will be a way to get as complete an estimate of A.S.D. prevalence as possible,\u201d she said in an e-mail, using the abbreviation for autism spectrum disorder.\n\nMost cases of autism spectrum disorder in the Korean study, the researchers said, turned up among children in regular schools who had no record of receiving special education or mental health services. A third were found among a \u201chigh-probability group\u201d of 294 children who were attending special-education schools or were listed on a registry of disabled children.\n\nThe children in that high-probability group were similar in many ways to children with autism in the United States and elsewhere. Fifty-nine percent were intellectually disabled, or mentally retarded; more than two-thirds had full-blown autism, as opposed to milder forms like Asperger\u2019s; and boys outnumbered girls five to one.\n\nAmong the children with autism spectrum disorder in regular schools, only 16 percent were intellectually disabled, more than two-thirds had a milder form of autism, and the ratio of boys to girls was unusually low: 2.5 to 1.\n\nIn addition, 12 percent of these children had a superior I.Q. \u2014 a higher proportion than found in the general population.\n\nResearchers used a two-step process to identify autism among ordinary schoolchildren: parents and teachers completed a 27-item questionnaire on each child, and children who scored in the autistic range on that questionnaire were individually evaluated.\n\n\u201cIf we had only looked at the high-probability group, we would have come up with about 0.7 percent, which is in line with C.D.C. statistics for the U.S.,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Roy Richard Grinker, a professor of anthropology and international affairs at George Washington University.\n\nThe surprisingly large proportion of cases uncovered in ordinary schools, he noted, may in part reflect the low level of awareness and high degree of stigma attached to autism in South Korea. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders may stand out less in South Korean schools, which follow highly structured and predictable routines and emphasize rote learning.\n\nOther experts said that more \u201cpopulation based\u201d studies, though costly, could help determine how broadly the Korean findings could be generalized to other societies.\n\nCraig J. Newschaffer, chairman of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Drexel School of Public Health in Philadelphia, praised the new report, calling it \u201cquite a strong study,\u201d but he added that the results were based on information about 63 percent of the schoolchildren, a good response rate but not ideal.\n\n\u201cIt is just one area of Korea,\u201d he said, \u201cand we know that there\u2019s random variation in how diseases are distributed.\u201d", "summary": "A comprehensive study in a district of a South Korean city found the prevalence of autism was more that twice that usually reported in the developed world.", "compression": 38.0714285714, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 2.8571428571, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

This is for the same reason that professional wrestling gets more viewers than \u201cBook TV.\u201d There\u2019s something compelling about a lot of grunting and body slams.\n\nLet\u2019s get focused. Time to discuss how Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton differ on the issues.\n\nYou forgot to mention Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\nAbout Clinton and Sanders. Their positions on most things are similar. They both favor universal prekindergarten and support gay marriage, reproductive rights and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. They both want to raise the minimum wage, but Sanders is shooting for $15 while Clinton says $12. They both have ambitious plans to fight climate change. Clinton wants to see more than half a billion solar panels in operation by 2020; Sanders has called for 10 million.\n\nHa! Who\u2019s the transformational thinker there, Bernie?\n\nWell, his campaign says it meant solar roofs. The more important point is that Sanders also wants a major tax on businesses that keep using fossil fuels. As we go along here, you will note that his proposals are almost all much bolder and that practically everything on his shopping list includes new or higher taxes on somebody. Occasionally everybody, although Sanders would argue that the little people will get their money back through things like free health care and generous family leave policies.\n\nClinton doesn\u2019t want to raise taxes?\n\nSome, but mainly on the superrich. Nothing on couples making less than $250,000.\n\nI vote the person, not the platform. Who would I like more?\n\nYou\u2019d like them both. These are politicians. They spend their lives trying to please people. You don\u2019t get to this level if nobody can stand being around you. Unless, of course, you\u2019re Ted Cruz.\n\nDo you think Sanders has so many young supporters because he\u2019s transformational or because he wants to make college free?\n\nThat\u2019s certainly a big applause line. This is another good way of looking at the candidates\u2019 differences. Sanders has a sweeping plan: free tuition at public colleges and universities, period. Clinton has a similar goal, but her plan is more complicated because she wants to screen out kids whose parents could afford to pay the freight themselves.\n\nSo his is easier to understand, while she avoids the problem of having to explain in the final election why the taxpayers should be underwriting chemistry class for Donald Trump\u2019s grandchildren.\n\nAre you going to talk about Wall Street? Preferably briefly. Without mentioning the repeal of Glass-Steagall.\n\nVery, very basically, Bernie Sanders has a dramatic plan to regulate the big banks, tax the speculators and punish Wall Street evildoers. Clinton would argue that the banks have been pretty well taken care of by the Dodd-Frank law and that what you really need to do is focus on the hedge funds. This is so oversimplified, I\u2019m kind of ashamed. Maybe we should go back and \u2026\n\nThat\u2019s plenty. Really! So Clinton isn\u2019t in the pocket of big special interests who paid her millions of dollars to give speeches?\n\nMany people think her Wall Street reform plan is O.K. But on a personal level, it was inexcusable of her to give those $200,000 speeches for investment bankers and the like when she knew she was going to be running for president. Not good at all.\n\nYou\u2019d better say something positive about Hillary Clinton now or I\u2019m going to call this quits.\n\nShe\u2019s stupendously smart. She has a lifetime record of fighting for good causes, particularly children and women\u2019s rights. She would almost certainly be a lot better at working with Congress than President Obama has been.\n\nWhat about a President Sanders? Could he actually do any of the stuff he\u2019s talking about?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine getting Congress to upgrade Obamacare to a single-payer system \u2014 what he describes as Medicare for all. You remember what an enormous lift it was to get any health care reform at all passed. But Sanders\u2019s theory is that by electing him, the people will be sending a message so strong even Congress can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nWow, do you think that could happen?\n\nThat\u2019s the bottom line of the whole contest. Vote for Bernie: Send a message. Vote for Hillary: She knows how to make things work.\n\nI would like to elect someone who can make things work while simultaneously sending a message.\n\nDo you ever watch those house-hunting shows where people make the list of what they want in their next home, and it\u2019s always a place in the heart of the city that\u2019s quiet and has green space for the dog and four bedrooms so guests can come visit, for no more than $500 a month?\n\nYou\u2019re saying I can\u2019t have everything.\n\nHey, wait until I ask you to choose between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.", "summary": "Let\u2019s look at how the two Democratic candidates \u2014 Martin who? \u2014 differ.", "compression": 60.1875, "coverage": 0.8125, "density": 0.9375, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "ML", "marked_as_extractive": false}

From online snooping, I knew we had differences. She was a registered Republican. I\u2019m a Democrat. (Facebook even labels me very liberal.) She had a son when she was a teenager, while I didn\u2019t marry or have children until my mid-30s.\n\nWith wobbly legs, I walked up her suburban driveway and knocked on her door. No one answered, and I left a letter with a picture of my family and me.\n\nThe next evening, my cellphone rang. She sounded suspicious but soon turned cordial.\n\nA few days later we met in a park in the middle of the state. Her warmth surprised me. She gave me a Greek \u201cevil eye,\u201d a glass trinket symbolizing our shared bloodline. All my life I had taken on the ethnicities of my adoptive parents, Irish and Polish. Now, I had an ethnicity of my own.\n\nI looked down at this strange eye in my hand. \u201cSo, does this wish evil on people?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sees evil and wards it off.\u201d\n\nShe had made Greek sandwiches for lunch and prepared a photo album for me, full of pictures of our mother. Now I knew where my older son\u2019s curly hair came from. She had even written me a poem.\n\nWe each had a sibling whose life had self-destructed: hers a sister, mine a brother. And we both had a direct way of speaking that some might construe as blunt, a trait I giddily saw as a genetic puzzle piece nestling into place.\n\nBut on other fundamentals, we diverged. She was not a college graduate. She had a pet pig named Link. To me, a city guy, the idea of having a pig as a pet struck me as cartoonishly rural.\n\nOur conversation touched on politics, and she referred to Barack Obama as \u201cour Muslim president.\u201d The comment hit me like a punch in the gut. I told her, in the most noncombative way I could, that he wasn\u2019t. She conceded nothing. We dropped it.\n\nWe had someone take a picture of us: me with my short dark hair and geeky glasses, her with her dark untamed curls and shades. In the photo, her smile is toothy and bright, her happiness made plain. My teeth are hidden, my smile inscrutable. Later, she would let on that this smile disappointed her.\n\nBut in the following weeks, our bond of new siblinghood drowned out our differences. We texted like addicted teenagers. She made my family homemade Greek food on a visit to her home. When she called me her \u201cshiny new brother,\u201d I swooned.\n\nThen one day she texted me a jarring image of a bumper sticker slogan: \u201c9MM beats 9-1-1 every time.\u201d\n\nI blinked at my screen. \u201cAre you a gun person btw?\u201d I asked. \u201cMight as well know that now lol.\u201d\n\nShe said she was licensed to carry, then asked if I had ever been \u201cdown to go to a gun range.\u201d\n\nI pondered this. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of necessary in certain contexts,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut in the context of me holding one, I think that\u2019s a bad context for a gun lol.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s seriously not a big deal!\u201d she said.\n\nI can\u2019t stand guns. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart to keep a gun in a home for self-defense, and not only because my boys are 5 and 2. I don\u2019t understand why someone would want to shoot a weapon for fun. To me, they\u2019re emblematic of brutishness.\n\nOur text blizzard tapered to a flurry, just occasional photos of enticing dinners mid-simmer and selfies with our children and spouses. She kept coaching me to smile bigger. I said I would try harder. As the presidential primary season grew increasingly ugly, we steered clear of politics.\n\nSix months ago, she told me she and her husband were buying a manufactured home on eight acres in a little town in north Florida, an even more conservative part of the state than where they had been living.\n\nShe had always wanted more land, and I was happy for her. But I also saw this as a widening of our rift, a rejection of the urban melting-pot lifestyle I had always embraced. At the same time, I longed to see her more, and now she would be two hours farther away. The news broke my heart.\n\nI poked fun in a thinly veiled attempt to get her to reconsider, saying that it would be so quiet there she would \u201cbe able to hear a mouse fart five miles away.\u201d\n\nThen, as hate-laced rhetoric and angry political rallies dominated the news, I began to worry anew: Does my sister support this?\n\nI could stay silent no longer. \u201cElection getting crazy,\u201d I texted. \u201cI gotta ask. Are you supporting Trump?\u201d\n\nThe response came quickly: \u201cYou and I will not discuss politics brother dear.\u201d\n\nA red heart emoji appeared in reply.\n\n\u201cWell whatever you do, I hope you\u2019re really, really paying attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cDitto,\u201d she replied. Another red heart.\n\nI told her that if we discussed it, maybe we could end up learning something about each other. For now, I said, I would have to assume she was supporting Trump.\n\nShe told me not to assume but didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown on me in this last year,\u201d she typed. \u201cI shall not ruin it xo.\u201d Another red heart.\n\nI didn\u2019t dare bring up politics again. But I couldn\u2019t help dwelling on it. I feared that a connection I had longed to make my entire life, my only link to my maternal roots, was now under political siege.\n\nWas I really going to allow stereotypes shaped by polarized political debates to sabotage my relationship with my own sister, who feeds me like a doting mother and protects me with a Greek evil eye? What did her views of the world matter when her view of me produced nothing but generosity and warmth?\n\nWe went silent for five days. Then she sent me a picture of a cat wearing glasses.\n\n\u201cLol it\u2019s the cat me!\u201d I replied.\n\nLater that month, I drove on rolling country roads past patches of fiery red wildflowers and a business flying a Confederate flag, until I rumbled along a dirt lane and arrived at her secluded home.\n\nI was greeted, as always, with a tight embrace. I handed her my usual flowers. She showed me an herb garden they had started with their daughter and took me into their pig\u2019s new, spacious pen. As I petted him, he bit my foot. It was harmless but I was spooked and jumped away, which we both found hilarious.\n\nShe gave me a tour of the rest of the woodsy property. From the road, the trees had looked dense. But once among them, I was surprised to find there was plenty of room to walk around. I found the quiet not isolating but soothing.\n\n\u201cI can see why you love it here,\u201d I told her.\n\nAll along, I had wanted a sibling soul mate. I got, instead, a sibling who holds opposite views and whose \u201cMuslim president\u201d remark appalls me to this day. But I also got a sibling who has been nothing but kind and generous to me over the nearly two years since we met, and I love her.\n\nWith family, you can\u2019t always resolve your differences.

The landscaper hired to spruce up the place for their spring wedding turns out to be a guru bent on leading his disciples back to the celestial plane whence he came. He decides to use the newcomers' front lawn as a launching pad. And you thought your contractor was a nightmare?\n\nThere's a lot that's right about \"People Are Wrong!,\" most prominently a lively young cast that infuse the proceedings with comic high spirits even when the musical begins to spin its wheels or even spin out of control. A co-production of the Vineyard and the Off Off Broadway company Target Margin Theater, the musical gets a dollop of hipster cred from John Flansburgh, one half of the popular rock duo They Might Be Giants. Mr. Flansburgh, who plays one of the luckless country weekenders, is married to Robin Goldwasser, who wrote the musical with Julia Greenberg.\n\nMs. Greenberg and Ms. Goldwasser, who also plays a role in the show, are rock songwriters who have never attempted a full-scale musical. They know their way around a catchy guitar riff and slip comfortably in and out of lilting folk balladry, driving electric-guitar romps and rockabilly hoedowns.\n\nTheir ease with such standard pop-rock formats may explain the choice to construct the musical entirely from songs; there is virtually no dialogue. This is a challenging formula, leaving little room for error. Although musicals gain immortality through their songs, their viability onstage derives equally from the strength of their stories and characters. Traditional theater-song formats are softer-edged and more malleable than rock tunes, leaving more scope for delineation of character and propulsion of plot. Rock songs, in which music tends to ride roughshod over lyrics, are not often asked to shoulder such burdens. They stumble under the weight pretty quickly in \"People Are Wrong!\"\n\nA smart, appealingly loopy tone draws us in. Young hipsters smugly pleased at their acquisition of a property in the Catskills, Russ (Mr. Flansburgh) and Terri (Erin Hill) celebrate their good fortune in a flavorful anthem with a singsong chorus. \"We can't hear your car alarms from our renovated barn,\" the chipper couple chant. Another neatly turned comic song introduces us to the goofily dressed, glassy-eyed bunch who man the counters at the Agway, the gardening emporium that figures big in the plot. They're spiritual enlightenment junkies, disciples of a fellow called Xanthus (David Driver): \"If you're looking for contentment and the commune's overbooked/ Or you're stuck inside an Ashram where your needs are overlooked/ It is Xanthus, he will save.\" Cue the entrance of said god, singing an Elvis-flavored paean to his own ponytail.\n\nUnfortunately, once the musical has introduced its off-kilter characters, established the simple storyline (crazy gardener screws up wedding plans) and put across its sardonic tone, it begins to disintegrate, even as the song list stretches past the horizon. Thirty titles are listed -- that's a full double CD, folks -- but the zany plot would be stretched thin to fill out even one. The songs become repetitive in their musical and narrative content, and the frequently clunky or slipshod rhyme schemes begin to grate. (\"Acid\" with \"wasted\" is a bit cockeyed). A few stand out for their satire -- for instance, the giddy duet Rick and Terri sing to celebrate having obtained the services of a much-coveted wedding planner -- but too many are devoted to embroidering the sillier aspects of the plot.\n\nThe staging by David Herskovits, the artistic director of Target Margin, doesn't disguise these flaws. The actors sing into traditional concert mikes, some hand-held, others on stands. The set is merely a stage carpeted in AstroTurf with a bright blue backdrop that looks vaguely like a game board, to which various symbolic gewgaws are affixed. With an onstage band (a really sharp one, by the way), the enterprise is stranded somewhere between a fully staged musical and a concert.\n\nStill, the performers hold your attention even when you give up on the musical. Ms. Hill, moving from cheery enthusiasm to outraged disbelief as the wedding nears, is clearly a more seasoned stage actor than her partner, Mr. Flansburgh, who mostly just sings, but they make a fun couple. Mr. Driver has the right wild-eyed intensity for his goofball role. Chris Anderson, with a nice light tenor, stands out as a character called Chainsaw Dick.\n\nIn fact the entire cast perform energetically but also with a friendly, let's-put-on-a-rock-musical spirit. They don't exactly follow through on that, but you're inclined to forgive them.\n\n'People Are Wrong!'

There is less of a consensus among meteorologists, who predict short-term weather patterns.\n\nJoe Bastardi, for example, a senior forecaster and meteorologist with AccuWeather, maintains that it is more likely that the planet is cooling, and he distrusts the data put forward by climate scientists as evidence for rising global temperatures.\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of consternation among a lot of us over the readjustment of data that is going on and some of the portrayals that we are seeing,\u201d Mr. Bastardi said in a video segment posted recently on AccuWeather\u2019s Web site.\n\nSuch skepticism appears to be widespread among TV forecasters, about half of whom have a degree in meteorology. A study released on Monday by researchers at George Mason University and the University of Texas at Austin found that only about half of the 571 television weathercasters surveyed believed that global warming was occurring and fewer than a third believed that climate change was \u201ccaused mostly by human activities.\u201d\n\nMore than a quarter of the weathercasters in the survey agreed with the statement \u201cGlobal warming is a scam,\u201d the researchers found.\n\nThe split between climate scientists and meteorologists is gaining attention in political and academic circles because polls show that public skepticism about global warming is increasing, and weather forecasters \u2014 especially those on television \u2014 dominate communications channels to the public. A study released this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason found that 56 percent of Americans trusted weathercasters to tell them about global warming far more than they trusted other news media or public figures like former Vice President Al Gore or Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThe George Mason-Texas survey found that about half of the weathercasters said they had discussed global warming on their broadcasts during chats with anchors, and nearly 90 percent said they had talked about climate change at live appearances at Kiwanis Club-type events.\n\nSeveral well-known forecasters \u2014 including John Coleman in San Diego and Anthony Watts, a retired Chico, Calif., weatherman who now has a popular blog \u2014 have been vociferous in their critiques of global warming.\n\nThe dissent has been heightened by recent challenges to climate science, including the discovery of errors in the 2007 report by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the unauthorized release of e-mail messages from a British climate research center last fall that skeptics say show that climate scientists had tried to suppress data.\n\n\u201cIn a sense the question is who owns the atmosphere: the people who predict it every day or the people who predict it for the next 50 years?\u201d said Bob Henson, a science writer for the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, who trained as a meteorologist and has followed the divide between the two groups.\n\nMr. Henson added, \u201cAnd the level of tension has really spiked in recent months.\u201d\n\nThe reasons behind the divergence in views are complex. The American Meteorological Society, which confers its coveted seal of approval on qualified weather forecasters, has affirmed the conclusion of the United Nations\u2019 climate panel that warming is occurring and that human activities are very likely the cause. In a statement sent to Congress in 2009, the meteorological society warned that the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to \u201cmajor negative consequences.\u201d\n\nYet, climate scientists use very different scientific methods from the meteorologists. Heidi Cullen, a climatologist who straddled the two worlds when she worked at the Weather Channel, noted that meteorologists used models that were intensely sensitive to small changes in the atmosphere but had little accuracy more than seven days out. Dr. Cullen said meteorologists are often dubious about the work of climate scientists, who use complex models to estimate the effects of climate trends decades in the future.\n\nBut the cynicism, said Dr. Cullen, who now works for Climate Central, a nonprofit group that works to bring the science of climate change to the public, is in her opinion unwarranted.\n\n\u201cThey are not trying to predict the weather for 2050, just generally say that it will be hotter,\u201d Dr. Cullen said of climatologists. \u201cAnd just like I can predict August will be warmer than January, I can predict that.\u201d\n\nThree years ago, Dr. Cullen found herself in a dispute with meteorologists after she posted a note on the Weather Channel\u2019s Web site suggesting that meteorologists should perhaps not receive certification from the meteorological society if they \u201ccan\u2019t speak to the fundamental science of climate change.\u201d\n\nResentment may also play a role in the divide. Climatologists are almost always affiliated with universities or research institutions where a doctoral degree is required. Most meteorologists, however, can get jobs as weather forecasters with a college degree.\n\n\u201cThere is a little bit of elitist-versus-populist tensions,\u201d Mr. Henson said. \u201cThere are meteorologists who feel, \u2018Just because I have a bachelor\u2019s degree doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhatever the reasons, meteorologists are far more likely to question the underlying science of climate change. A study published in the January 2009 newsletter of the American Geophysical Union, the professional association of earth scientists, found that while nearly 90 percent of some 3,000 climatologists who responded agreed that there was evidence of human-driven climate change, 80 percent of all earth scientists and 64 percent of meteorologists agreed with the statement. Only economic geologists who specialized in industrial uses of materials like oil and coal were more skeptical.\n\nSeeing danger in the divide between climate scientists and meteorologists, a variety of groups concerned with educating the public on climate change \u2014 including the National Environmental Education Foundation, a federally financed nonprofit, and Yale \u2014 are working to close the gap with research and educational forums. In 2008, Yale began holding seminars with weathercasters who are unsure about the climate issue and scientists who are leading experts in the field. The Columbia Journalism Review explored the reasons for the split in an article this year.\n\nConversely, the Heartland Institute, a free-market research organization skeptical about the causes and severity of climate change, is also making efforts to reach out. At its annual conference to be held in May in Chicago, the institute tried without success to put on a special session for the weather predictors.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve recognized is that the everyday person doesn\u2019t come across climatologists, but they do come across meteorologists,\u201d said Melanie Fitzpatrick, a climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cMeteorologists do need to understand more about climate because the public confuses this so much.

Knight Foundation; and the Public Radio Exchange, known as PRX.\n\nKQED, based in San Francisco, and the Knight Foundation are each investing $1.25 million in the initial $2.5 million fund and will have an equity stake in any projects that become viable businesses. PRX, based in Cambridge, Mass., is contributing strategic and management support. The project was announced a year ago as a PRX endeavor to be financed by Knight, before KQED became an investor.\n\nWhile the partners would love to find the next Google, KQED, which just had two years of record-setting revenue, does not expect to get rich from the venture, John Boland, KQED\u2019s president, said in a telephone interview.\n\nInstead, Mr. Boland said, he is looking for ideas, whether new ways to distribute and share content, raise money or allow KQED\u2019s audience to \u201cengage more deeply with the content and with others.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to help KQED reinvent itself in an era where its television ratings have been steadily declining and its radio audience is flat, he said. Broadcast audiences have stagnated even as KQED\u2019s online and mobile audiences have boomed. Demand for its increased offering of local and regional news has been strong as commercial newspapers and television stations have cut back.\n\nBeing in the Silicon Valley area, KQED should be \u201ctapping into the innovation ecosystem\u201d outside its doors, Mr. Boland said. He said the accelerator was \u201cspecifically designed to attract creative people, entrepreneurs, who have ideas that relate to what we\u2019re calling \u2018media for good.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMark Perry, a KQED board member who is a general partner in the venture capital firm NEA, called the accelerator \u201ca tremendous opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs this new media world evolves we\u2019re going to need more innovation around \u2014 not the content development, because that we know how to do \u2014 but how these productions can be distributed in the most effective way across these multiple platforms,\u201d Mr. Perry said by telephone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much to stimulate the innovative side of our entire organization as it is to come up with any particular technique, particular technology or particular insight that may come out,\u201d he said. But entrepreneurs are likely to be attracted to the model because KQED is a potential customer for any project that does work, he said.\n\nMichael Maness, Knight Foundation\u2019s vice president for journalism and media innovation, in a telephone interview said the accelerator also has the potential to speed the learning process for entrepreneurs in the news business. The foundation will also be able to publicly share insights gained from the projects, unlike those generated by private equity accelerators, he added.\n\nThe accelerator will be led by Corey Ford, a former producer for the PBS program \u201cFrontline.\u201d Mr. Ford most recently built Runway, an accelerator for the Google chairman Eric E. Schmidt\u2019s early stage venture capital firm, Innovation Endeavors.\n\nMatter Ventures will finance four rounds of five teams each over two years. Each of the 20 teams selected will get $50,000, mentoring from the KQED staff, and educational workshops, as well as work space in the Matter Ventures\u2019 headquarters in the South Park section of San Francisco, just blocks from KQED.\n\n\u201cA big part of this is about the culture and the community that you create,\u201d Mr. Ford said.

Pendulum Swing", "date": "2008041319", "text": "But more broadly, the turmoil is better understood as a reaction \u2014 or overreaction, in the eyes of some in the industry \u2014 to a long-term shift, over two presidencies, in the way the F.A.A. oversees the airlines.\n\nIn the 1990s, the agency was more of a cop on the beat, handing out penalties to those who broke the rules.\n\n\u201cYou used to fear an F.A.A. inspector showing up,\u201d said Joseph Tiberi, a spokesman with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. \u201cThey checked everything from the nuts and bolts in your tool kit to the paperwork in the cockpit.\u201d\n\nBut then a different, more collaborative approach emerged that critics say went too far. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, which crippled the industry, the agency began \u201ca creep away from their rigorous oversight of maintenance,\u201d said Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and the chairman of the House committee that has pushed the issue.\n\nThat arrangement was \u201ccoddling the airlines,\u201d he added, which eased the burden on the F.A.A., with its inspectors spending more time on paperwork than on airplanes.\n\nThe change began after the T.W.A. 800 and ValuJet disasters in the mid-1990s, when regulators and the industry convened a \u201csafety summit.\u201d Then the Clinton administration formed a national commission in 1997 on aviation safety and security, led by Vice President Al Gore and known as the Gore Commission. It set a goal of cutting the rate of fatal accidents 80 percent over 10 years.\n\nOne idea was for the F.A.A. to start working more closely with the industry. If airlines shared their mistakes or problems without fear of retribution, the reasoning went, the system would benefit from these shared lessons.\n\nAnd it seems to have. Over the next decade, the accident rate fell 65 percent, and this new approach is widely seen as having played a role in the drop.\n\nThen the F.A.A., under the Bush administration, took on a role after the Sept. 11 attacks to help the industry recover \u2014 \u201cthrough technology, through greater efficiencies, through sensible and non-burdensome regulatory schemes,\u201d Marion C. Blakey, the F.A.A. administrator in 2002, said at the time. She declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThis more collaborative approach was reflected in a \u201ccustomer service initiative\u201d announced by the F.A.A. in April 2003.\n\nThe customers in this case were not passengers; they were the airlines the F.A.A. regulates. The core principles of the new initiative, which inspectors could print up on pocket-size cards, included creating for the airlines \u201can environment without fear of retribution if you challenge our decisions\u201d and \u201cclear guidance on how you can elevate your concerns to the next higher level of authority.\u201d\n\nThe F.A.A.\u2019s watchdog role, to many Democrats in Congress who now oversee airline regulators, grew toothless. \u201cWe had drifted a little bit too much toward the over-closeness and coziness between regulator and regulated,\u201d said H. Clayton Foushee Jr., a former F.A.A. official who led a recent inquiry by Mr. Oberstar\u2019s committee.\n\nSome inspectors in the field were also concerned by the drift. In early 2003, Charalambe Boutris, an inspector in the F.A.A.\u2019s Dallas office, began reviewing Southwest\u2019s engine maintenance records.\n\nThe task would seem the equivalent of the Maytag repairman\u2019s job, since Southwest has a stellar safety record. But Mr. Boutris discovered the airline\u2019s record-keeping was inconsistent and varied from aircraft to aircraft, according to the United States Office of Special Counsel, which reviewed his accusations.\n\nAfter raising the issue with a supervisor, Mr. Boutris was told he could send Southwest a letter expressing concern, but not a more serious \u201cletter of investigation,\u201d which is what regulations called for under such circumstances.\n\nHe continued to find problems with the airline\u2019s record-keeping, and again pressed for an investigation. But his supervisor again chose a slap-on-the-wrist letter, and Southwest officials began to lobby for Mr. Boutris\u2019s removal.\n\nYet problems remained. In January 2007, the airline discovered cracks on some of its Boeing 737s. Less than two months later, an unidentified whistle-blower in the F.A.A.\u2019s Chicago office noticed a crack in a Southwest jet that had been flown the day before.\n\nEarlier this year, Southwest told the F.A.A. that it had flown 46 planes without the required inspections of fuselage panels, operating the defective planes for up to nine months on more than 61,000 flights. That \u201cself-disclosure\u201d normally would have allowed Southwest to avoid financial penalties as long as it fixed the problems. And it kept flying the planes.\n\nIt also flew 27 planes that were not in compliance with an F.A.A. directive requiring inspections of cargo doors.\n\nBefore the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearings on April 3, Mr. Boutris and another inspector, Douglas Peters, testified about being told by supervisors to ignore violations by Southwest. \u201cMy supervisor was suppressing my authority and responsibility to report them in accordance with mandated F.A.A. guidance,\u201d Mr. Boutris testified.\n\nThe two men, who say they have received threats over their decision to expose the airline, have become \u201crock stars\u201d within aviation safety circles, Mr. Foushee said.\n\nMr. Foushee said he began to hear \u201cnoise\u201d as soon as he joined the committee in January 2007 about the relationship between the airlines and the agency.\n\n\u201cF.A.A. people would call me, and contact me, saying, \u2018We\u2019re not able to do our jobs anymore,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Foushee, who worked for a law firm in Washington before joining the committee staff.\n\nHe spoke first with Mr. Peters, who contacted him anonymously. He then spoke with Mr. Boutris and began the committee\u2019s investigation into the conduct of the airlines and the agency.\n\nThe two men \u201cturned over incontrovertible evidence that what happened happened,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the committee began circulating a damning report on how the agency had treated the two whistle-blowers, written by the Special Counsel\u2019s office, the F.A.A. decided it had to act. It ordered a nationwide audit and relieved Mr. Boutris\u2019s supervisor of his safety responsibilities.\n\nNow the F.A.A. is conducting a broad national audit, which led to the grounding of all MD-80s in the American Airlines fleet. More groundings of other planes throughout the industry are likely to occur in coming weeks as the audit continues. American, for its part, said it would resume its normal schedule on Sunday.\n\nMore disclosures about lax inspections are likely, Mr. Oberstar said.\n\n\u201cThere are more people coming to us with reports of stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cThey said, \u2018No one was listening to us for last six or seven years; now we\u2019ve got someone who understands the problems, understands the safety implications.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe said the new reports came from all around the country, not just the regional office responsible for Southwest Airlines.\n\n\u201cPilots talk to me, flight attendants talk to me, ramp mechanics have stopped me and said, \u2018I want you to know this is happening,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Oberstar said.\n\nA number of industry officials, however, call the latest crackdown an overreaction, pointing to American\u2019s decision to park all 300 of its MD-80s while it checked whether their wiring complied with a safety directive.\n\nOne senior executive at another airline, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the agency\u2019s new stance reflects the new tone in aviation safety.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you wouldn\u2019t have grounded the whole fleet,\u201d the executive said. \u201cThere\u2019s a question of what\u2019s rational and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nA change in procedures seems likely. Tom Brantley, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, the inspectors\u2019 union, testified on April 3 that inspectors have been defanged by the F.A.A. itself.\n\nFor example, he said, if the inspectors show up without warning, he said, airlines would complain to their F.A.A. superiors that \u201cthey\u2019re slowing us down, they\u2019re asking people questions, they\u2019re costing us money.\u201d\n\nAnd the agency seems likely to change its procedure for \u201cself-reporting\u201d and avoiding penalties. Two F.A.A. managers have been transferred, and others may lose their jobs.\n\nPassengers will have to endure more canceled flights in coming weeks. But they are also left to make sense of mixed signals \u2014 about planes that rarely crash anymore but whose safety is suddenly in doubt, and about an agency that was long considered best-in-class that suddenly seems broken.\n\nThe unraveling relationship between the F.A.A. and the airlines is \u201clike a divorce,\u201d said James E. Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cAnd the children are the passengers.\u201d\n\nMr. Oberstar said these were \u201cdifficult times for the passengers,\u201d with, by his count, 568 aircraft grounded so far. \u201cBut I think they\u2019d rather be on the ground than 7 miles in the air, with no way to pull over to the curb and check under the hood,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthew L.
