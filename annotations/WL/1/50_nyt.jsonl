Bullwinkle sprung a leak, spewing a blast of helium from his nose yards from the finish line. And giant M&Ms, Sonic the Hedgehog and SpongeBob SquarePants have all crashed into objects on the street.\n\nBut only once in the 87-year history of the Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thanksgiving Day Parade has bad weather grounded the towering balloons that float through the streets of Manhattan on the holiday.\n\nNow, a storm bearing down on the East Coast is once again placing the fate of the balloons in doubt.\n\nThe balloons can rise as high as five stories and can be difficult to control in wind.\n\nAfter a Cat in the Hat balloon hit a lamp post at West 72nd Street and Central Park West in 1997, knocking a portion down and injuring four spectators, city officials instituted strict wind guidelines.\n\nIf the wind blows at 23 m.p.h. or more and gusts reach 34 m.p.h., SpongeBob and the biggest of his inflatable brethren will be grounded. The decision will be made on Thursday morning by several agencies.\n\nJoe Picca, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we are seeing right now is that at about 7 a.m. winds will be out of the west-northwest at about 25 miles per hour, but gusts could be as high as 40 miles per hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Picca continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we expect the winds to be on a downward trend as the day goes on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe noted that a challenge in forecasting winds in New York City has to do with the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccanyon effect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the tall buildings along the parade route creating a tunnel.\n\nHistorically, the blocks near Times Square have been particularly difficult for the balloons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 handlers, with the open area allowing winds to whip with added force.\n\nRegardless of the big balloons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inclusion, the parade is to begin at 9 a.m. on 77th Street, where on Wednesday green tarps secured with sandbags covered the pavement and metal barricades cut off access to the street.\n\nAs a steady rain fell, workers readied for the nightlong ritual of inflating the balloons on West 77th and West 81st Streets.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt says to me that balloons are flying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jennifer George, 54, a designer and author who has lived on West 77th Street for 22 years.\n\nBut if the wind howls as predicted, they will not be paraded. The balloons will be unzipped and deflated, folded up right there on the Upper West Side and sent back to New Jersey.\n\nThe last time the balloons were grounded was in 1971, because of foul weather.\n\nThe only other reason the balloons did not fly was World War II, when the entire parade was canceled for several years.\n\nThe wind rules apply only to the group of 16 giant balloons, like Pikachu and Spider-Man. The less celebrated, smaller balloons, like a baseball and a smattering of star shapes, still have a chance if the weather gets bad.\n\nShould the biggest balloons launch, each would be assigned a police sergeant, equipped with monitors to measure the wind speed during the parade, along with the usual team of handlers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done a lot of training on this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.\n\nMr. Kelly, 72, himself has firsthand experience: As a teenager he manned the ropes of a giant turkey balloon while working for Macy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, long before the wind rules were drawn up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose were the days when you really had to hold on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nJ.

A 34-year-old man who on Saturday hit a car while drunk, injured the other driver and subsequently praised the acts of the gunmen when the police detained him, was sentenced Monday to four years in prison.\n\nAll told, up to 100 people are under investigation for making or posting comments that support or try to justify terrorism, according to C\u00e9dric Cabut, a prosecutor in Bourgoin-Jalieu, in the east of France. The French news media have reported about cases in Paris, Toulouse, Nice, Strasbourg, Orl\u00e9ans and elsewhere in France.\n\nThe arrests have raised questions about a double standard for free speech here, with one set of rules for the cartoonists who freely skewered religions of all kinds, even when Muslims, Catholics and others objected, and yet were defended for their right to do so, and another set for the statements by Muslim supporters of the gunmen, which have led to their prosecution.\n\nBut French law does prohibit speech that might invoke or support violence. And prosecutors, who on Wednesday were urged by the Ministry of Justice to fight and prosecute \u201cwords or acts of hatred\u201d with \u201cutmost vigor,\u201d are relying particularly on new tools under a law adopted in November to battle the threat of jihadism. The law includes prison sentences up to seven years for backing terrorism.\n\nSome of those who were cited under the new law have already been sentenced, with the criminal justice system greatly accelerated, moving from accusations to trial and imprisonment in as little as three days.\n\nProsecutors seized on the law in the days after the terrorist attacks in Paris, which left 17 people dead \u2014 12 at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a weekly newspaper that was targeted in retaliation for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. A notice from the Ministry of Justice on Jan. 12 directed prosecutors to react firmly.\n\nThe accused did not have to threaten actual violence to run afoul of the law. According to Mr. Cabut, who brought the case in Bourgoin-Jalieu, the man shouted, \u201cThey killed Charlie and I had a good laugh. In the past they killed Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Mohammed Merah and many brothers. If I didn\u2019t have a father or mother, I would train in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe most prominent case now pending in the French courts is that of Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, a provocative humorist who has been a longtime symbol in France of the battle between free speech and public safety. With nearly 40 previous arrests on suspicion of violating antihate laws, for statements usually directed at Jews, he was again arrested on Wednesday, this time for condoning terrorism.\n\nHe faces trial in early February in connection with a Facebook message he posted, declaring, \u201cTonight, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly.\u201d It was a reference to the popular slogan of solidarity for the murdered Charlie Hebdo cartoonists \u2014 \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d \u2014 and one of the attackers, Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman and later four people in a kosher supermarket last Friday.\n\nProsecutors and other lawyers say the difference is laid out in French law, which unlike United States laws, limits what can be said or done in specific categories. Because of its World War II history, for example, France has speech laws that specifically address anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. In the case of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, prosecutors said, the targets were ideas and concepts, and though deemed extreme by some, the satire was meted out broadly.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say that it\u2019s unjust to support Charlie Hebdo and then allow Dieudonn\u00e9 to be censored,\u201d said Mathieu Davy, a lawyer who specializes in media rights. \u201cBut there are clear limits in our legal system. I have the right to criticize an idea, a concept or a religion. I have the right to criticize the powers in my country. But I don\u2019t have the right to attack people and to incite hate.\u201d\n\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Thursday both sought to quash any backlash against Muslims, in the wake of the Islamic militants\u2019 attacks. As they have also done in recent days, they raised the issue of anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cWe must be clear between ourselves, lucid,\u201d Mr. Hollande told an audience at the Institute of the Arab World in Paris. He said that inequalities and conflicts that had persisted for years had fueled radical Islam.\n\n\u201cThe Muslims are the first victims of fanaticism, extremism and intolerance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrench Muslims have the same rights, the same duties as all citizens,\u201d Mr. Hollande said.\n\nPope Francis joined the debate while traveling to the Philippines from Sri Lanka, saying that while he defended freedom of expression, there were also limits.\n\n\u201cYou cannot provoke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot insult the faith of others. You cannot make fun of the faith of others.\u201d\n\nMr. Cabut said only a few cases had been heard under the recent antiterrorism law, until prosecutors began using it liberally in the last week. Its provisions target hate speech and are designed to deal more severely with comments posted on the Internet. If the offense is spoken, the law allows a sentence of five years and a fine of almost $90,000. If it is on the Internet, it allows sentencing up to seven years and a fine of nearly $120,000. .\n\n\u201cI think there is an atmosphere of emotion where people are still in a state of shock,\u201d Mr. Cabut said. \u201cSo it\u2019s necessary for prosecutors to act firmly.\u201d\n\nHe said that there were limits to how far prosecutors would follow the law. For instance, he said, no one would be prosecuted for refusing to stand during a moment of silence, which has occurred in his region.\n\nBut that has already been put to the test with a new case on Thursday involving a parking attendant in Paris who was suspended by the police prefecture for refusing to observe a silent tribute to the victims.\n\nCatherine Perbet, a lawyer who has defended people accused of condoning violence, said the law was being used harshly now because of the political and social climate. She represented the man in Bourgoin-Jalieu and said his prosecution and sentence \u201cis not shocking given the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAgn\u00e8s Tricoire, a lawyer who specializes in media rights and freedom of expression, said the power of the law was disturbing and that no one had anticipated how quickly it could be employed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much simpler now for the prosecutor to sue people who said or wrote something,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does it mean to make an apology for terrorism? Is it a simple sentence? Do you have to have an argument? Is it something that has to be taken seriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d she added, \u201cis not good for human rights.\u201d\n\nExcept for one of the heroes in the attacks, as the authorities sped up the immigration process for Lassana Bathily, a Muslim from Mali, who hid customers during the attack on the kosher market and then helped the hostages and the police. The authorities said he had been made a French citizen.\n\nReporting was contributed by Ma\u00efa de la Baume, Daphne Angl\u00e8s and Yann Cres from Paris, Alison Smale from Berlin, Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul, Raphael Minder from Madrid, Spain, James Kanter from Brussels, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.", "summary": "In separate speeches, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Chancellor Angela Merkel struck similar tones in urging tolerance and inclusiveness.", "compression": 77.05, "coverage": 0.6, "density": 1.5, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

Exposito. The video was part of a reality television pilot, \u201cMiami\u2019s Finest SOS,\u201d a project with the enthusiastic backing of Chief Exposito. \u201cOur guys were proactively going out there, like predators,\u201d he says during his cameo in the video, which surfaced online in January.\n\nA few weeks later, a Miami police officer shot and killed a black man during a traffic stop at North Miami Avenue and 75th Street in the Little Haiti neighborhood. The man, Travis McNeil, 28, was unarmed and never left the driver\u2019s seat of his rental car when he was shot once in the chest, members of his family said.\n\nMr. McNeil was the seventh African-American man to be shot and killed by Miami police officers in eight months. The shootings in this racially polarized city have led to marches on the Police Department\u2019s headquarters and calls for a Justice Department investigation, and the city manager has initiated an investigation into the chief\u2019s record.\n\nAfter pushing for action for weeks, the families of the seven shooting victims will speak at a City Commission meeting on Thursday.

They will try to de-escalate situations rather than resorting to deadly force.\u201d\n\nThe officer who shot Mr. McNeil is Reinaldo Goyo, a member of the city\u2019s elite gang unit who appeared in the \u201cMiami\u2019s Finest SOS\u201d video. (The TV show has since been shelved.)\n\nSaying on the video: \u201cI\u2019ve got some style. I\u2019ve got some flavor\u201d while wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the words \u201cThe Punisher,\u201d Detective Goyo says he and his partner inherited the nicknames Crockett and Tubbs after the lead characters in the 1980s TV show \u201cMiami Vice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s got a nice little ring to it,\u201d he says.\n\nDetective Goyo would not comment, a police spokesman said. A lawyer for Detective Goyo did not respond to phone messages.\n\nChief Exposito said he thought the video was \u201cexcellent,\u201d although in an e-mail to the production company in December, he acknowledged that he regretted using the word \u201cpredator\u201d and asked that his quotation be changed. In another e-mail to one of his assistants, he wrote: \u201cThis statement would add fuel to the fire. They need to soften it!\u201d\n\nIn an interview last week, Chief Exposito said the video was not supposed to be for public consumption. \u201cI had a problem with the production company \u2014 it was not supposed to be on YouTube or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nThe chief also defended the officer who said, \u201cI like to hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHunting doesn\u2019t mean you go kill people,\u201d the chief said. \u201cHunting means you go out there and capture people.\u201d\n\nMiami has a long history of racially charged police shootings, some of which combusted into deadly riots and Justice Department inquiries that ended with police officers in prison. The pattern this time is familiar: All seven men who were fatally shot by the police were African-American; the police officers who shot them are all Hispanic.\n\n\u201cThere is a wide range of growing concern in the community regarding the apparent lack of communication and response to these incidents by the City of Miami Police Department,\u201d Representative Frederica S.

That would be funny if it weren\u2019t so sad. Sure, Mr. Gross has interviewed people who live large in the gilded ghetto made up of Bel Air, Beverly Hills and Holmby Hills, a region that he actually refers to as \u201cLa-La Land.\u201d But his reportorial position is that of a gawker-stalker whose curiosity and cupidity far outweigh his reportorial talents. What\u2019s more, he has made a career out of this.\n\nMr. Gross has already written books about the ugly side of modeling, the bogus side of Ralph Lauren\u2019s patrician affectations, the \u201clust, lies, greed and betrayals\u201d (that\u2019s his official subtitle) behind the \u201cRogues\u2019 Gallery\u201d that is the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the tenant roster of 740 Park Avenue. None of these really required him to spend time outdoors. But in \u201cUnreal Estate\u201d he gets nosy about grandiose estates, and these places tend to be gated. As Mr. Gross acknowledges, he got some of his information from a California real estate blog that gossips breathlessly about blueprints and that reprints photographs from brokers\u2019 brochures.\n\nArmed with such second-hand information and whatever can be gleaned from public records Mr. Gross often seems to be ticking off descriptions of places he hasn\u2019t seen. Some of them no longer exist or have been heavily renovated, which makes the job that much harder. He winds up with a \u201ccan you top this?\u201d catalog of so-called amenities: Who had the monkey house? Who had the Wurlitzer carousel? Who had five kitchens, one of them highly ventilated and devoted to \u201cspicy\u201d (i.e. odiferous) food? This kind of information can be remarkably uninteresting when it is piled into a 488-page heap.\n\nBy the way, Mr. Gross has not bothered to provide end notes for each bit of information because \u201cthat would have made a hefty book even fatter.\u201d Note to his publisher: There are other ways to keep a book\u2019s length under control.\n\nThe early chapters of \u201cUnreal Estate\u201d are as dry as Los Angeles would have been without the lucrative deals that provided irrigation, deals that make for particularly arid reading. (Forget it, Jake \u2014 it\u2019s Chinatown.) The pioneering estate builders are given their due, but the details definitely lack glitter. (Alphonzo E. Bell, as in Bel Air, \u201clost six years of his life and his good name to the cement-plant fight.\u201d) But \u201cUnreal Estate,\u201d which follows each of seven particular estates from owner to owner, duly ticks off the origins of Grayhall, Greenacres, Greystone and four less alliterative showplaces. So it takes quite a while before Jayne Mansfield, Engelbert Humperdinck, Sonny, Cher and George Hamilton move in, and the tawdriness gets more interesting.\n\nMr. Gross makes the same overall point that he has made before: \u201cGreat houses aren\u2019t always homes for happy families.\u201d In other words, he is on a search for schadenfreude, and he doesn\u2019t have to look far. What goes up has a way of coming down. Showoffs will sooner or later die off, and their offspring can be bitterly litigious. And, as he puts it, \u201cmost houses that offer more than rudimentary shelter are in some sense acts of ego.\u201d Some of this book\u2019s most notable acts of ego involve filling the large houses with harems of \u201cmodel-actress-whatevers,\u201d to the point where even pimping and depravity start to sound boring.\n\n\u201cUnreal Estate\u201d is written as if it were Mad Libs for the rich and famous. The areas that Mr. Gross describes are the most _____, _____, _____ and _____ communities on earth. (\u201cExclusive,\u201d \u201cprestigious,\u201d \u201cluxurious,\u201d \u201cenvy-inducing.\u201d) We and he could never live there. \u201cNot only that, we will probably never even visit unless we work for a\u201d _____, _____ or _____ \u2014 that is, \u201ccaterer,\u201d \u201clandscaper\u201d or \u201cprivate security firm.\u201d\n\nSo, part of the problem is dull writing. But the dullness of the book\u2019s players is more damaging. A long chapter revisits the escapades of the disgraced financier Bernard Cornfeld, which have been thoroughly explored elsewhere and bring in unwelcome bit players like Robert Vesco and Heidi Fleiss. And times have changed so much since Mr. Cornfeld\u2019s heyday that the most newly interesting fact about his life is barely mentioned. The type of \u201cblue box\u201d illegally used in the Cornfeld entourage for making free long-distance phone calls was among the first joint projects of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs.\n\nAnother sign of changing times is the cast of characters that Mr. Gross must describe, like Richard Symington, \u201cthe millionaire owner of Muzak and the father of the modern rebirth of body piercing,\u201d who has a loose connection to the estate of the silent film star Harold Lloyd. More recent figures include Mark Hughes, the Herbalife tycoon, and Roland Arnall, \u201cthe Johnny Appleseed of the subprime mortgage industry.\u201d The \u201cfront man for California\u2019s first roller disco\u201d also appears late in the book. Mr. Gross is not the social historian who will make sense of the sea changes that bring in new waves.\n\nGiven that the main preoccupation of \u201cUnreal Estate\u201d is staring, the book is startlingly reluctant to provide illustrations. The one map that appears is useless, and it does not serve even the most basic purpose required: to show the locations of the seven houses that are main characters. (Privacy is not an issue. The book is happy to provide street addresses.) And there are very few photographs of these seven principals. Mr. Gross took his inspiration, if that\u2019s the word, from a coffee-table book on Beverly Hills estates. It is appropriately costly and hard to find, but its pictures probably tell a better story.", "summary": "In \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnreal Estate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Gross gets nosy about grandiose estates, places that tend to be gated.", "compression": 66.3333333333, "coverage": 0.8888888889, "density": 3.7777777778, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

These little bloodsuckers have made a meal of me around the globe, and I\u2019ve longed for a definitive guide to repelling them. What really works? When and where are extra precautions necessary?\n\nI turned to scientists who study mosquito behavior to find out. They took a break from investigating neurons and odor receptors to offer travel advice, including whether to spend money on botanical repellents and why it might be wise to forgo that glass of wine.\n\nRepelling mosquitoes isn\u2019t just a matter of avoiding unsightly, itchy bumps. Mosquitoes spread some of the world\u2019s most deadly diseases. Malaria alone kills about a million people a year, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\u201cMosquitoes are able to seek out a human being like a guided missile,\u201d said Anandasankar Ray, a scientist at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nIt helps to know your enemy in order to conquer her (yes, her \u2014 only female mosquitoes bite). To that end, let\u2019s briefly consider the situation from the mosquito\u2019s point of view.\n\nAs it turns out, you play a part in her raison d\u2019\u00eatre. She bites you, explained Dr. Ray, because she requires material from your blood to produce her eggs. Imagine a mosquito flitting about when suddenly she encounters a little cloud of carbon dioxide. This plume is one of many coming out of your mouth as you lounge poolside in Rio with a caipirinha. Special sensors allow the mosquito to detect the plume, a sign that a living vertebrate is near.\n\nAs she draws close to the source, her sensors pick up odors emitted from your skin. These odors, many of which are produced by bacteria in your skin, help the mosquito determine that you\u2019re not a horse or a dog but a human \u2014 her favorite meal. She homes in on you, possibly aided by infrared radiation coming off your warm body.\n\n\u201cAlmost like in the \u2018Predator\u2019 movies,\u201d Dr. Ray said.\n\nThen \u2014 zap! \u2014 she pierces the nape of your neck, extracting the drops of blood necessary for the creation of her progeny.\n\nBut back to you and your needs.\n\nTAKING COVER To protect yourself, you must know where and when the mosquitoes that carry debilitating diseases \u2014 malaria, filariasis, yellow fever, dengue \u2014 bite.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in Central America, South America, Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia \u2014 all of these places that are the most beautiful travel destinations, it\u2019s really a concern,\u201d said Leslie B. Vosshall, a scientist at Rockefeller University in New York who works with flies, mosquitoes and humans to study how odor is processed and perceived.\n\nDengue and yellow fever are primarily spread by Aedes aegypti, mosquitoes that live in tropical and subtropical areas \u2014 though they are increasingly found in urban areas \u2014 including Africa, Asia, North America, the Caribbean and Latin America (pay attention, World Cup travelers). This species bites during the day. Feeding typically spikes a couple of hours after sunrise and late afternoon, said Dr. Ray, whose findings about mosquito receptors, published last year in the journal Cell, could eventually help control disease transmission.\n\nEach year about 50 to 100 million people get dengue fever, a viral infection that often requires hospitalization and can develop into deadly hemorrhagic fever, according to the W.H.O. There is no vaccine and no cure. Bed nets, said Dr. Ray, are a must.\n\nAedes aegypti can also transmit the chikungunya virus, which causes fever and joint pain. Chikungunya has hit Asia, Africa, India, Europe and the Americas (and into the eastern Caribbean this winter), according to the W.H.O. While there is no cure, most patients recover, though joint pain can persist for months or years.\n\nAnother species, Culex, may carry lymphatic filariasis, an infection that can result in elephantiasis. Places most at risk include Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Nepal, Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Culex mosquitoes can also carry West Nile virus, found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia. These mosquitoes prefer birds but will bite humans, too. In the evening you may see them on the walls of your hotel room.\n\n\u201cThey will try and descend on you while sleeping,\u201d Dr. Ray said. Use a bed net.\n\nAnopheles gambiae, mosquitoes that can spread malaria, often bite at dusk and late at night, Dr. Ray said. The W.H.O. says travelers are at risk of malaria infection in 99 countries, mostly in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Yet unlike dengue and chikungunya, malaria can be prevented, even treated, with medication.\n\nWHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN\u2019T \u201cThe gold standard of insect repellency continues to be DEET,\u201d Dr. Ray said. Developed by the Army in 1946, DEET is a chemical that can melt your nail polish. That said, the Environmental Protection Agency does not consider it to be a health concern if it is used infrequently and properly. (The agency\u2019s DEET toxicity study is at epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0002fact.pdf.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s the most effective skin repellent on earth,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said.\n\nDEET is sold in concentrations from less than 5 percent to 100 percent. Wearing long sleeves and pants will reduce the amount you need to use. Still, covering up (even in clothing with built-in repellent) is not foolproof. \u201cIf they\u2019re very desperate,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said, mosquitoes will \u201cbite through jeans.\u201d\n\nAn alternative is Avon Skin So Soft with picaridin, a synthetic version of piperine, the active component of black pepper. (Unlike DEET, it won\u2019t dissolve plastics.)\n\nWhat about natural botanical repellents that rely on plant extracts?\n\n\u201cIt smells better and it doesn\u2019t melt your sunglasses,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said. But \u201cthe scientific evidence that those things work is weak to nonexistent.\u201d\n\nSome travelers swear by slapping on a vitamin B patch or eating garlic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably going to repel your friends but it really wouldn\u2019t have an effect on mosquitoes,\u201d Dr. Ray said.\n\nYet certain unconventional techniques can help, like taking showers (mosquitoes are drawn to sweat that has been on your skin for a while, Dr. Ray said) and, for reasons that remain unclear, avoiding alcohol.\n\n\u201cWhen people drink alcohol they become attractive to mosquitoes,\u201d he said. (And you thought that only worked on other humans.)\n\nThere are also spatial repellents, which you should buy if you are vacationing in a country with mosquito-borne diseases and your accommodations do not have window screens. The safest of these repellents release a low amount of insecticide, like ThermaCELL lanterns, which use butane cartridges to heat mats saturated with repellent that then rises into the air. The effect of long-term exposure, however, is not clear. The OFF! clip-on mosquito repellent battery-powered fan also circulates repellent (the active ingredient is metofluthrin, which is a neurotoxicant). This will work if, for example, you\u2019re camping and clip it inside your tent, said Dr. Ray, but not necessarily outdoors on a breezy day.\n\nCitronella candles and oils \u201cwork somewhat,\u201d he said. So does having someone around whom mosquitoes find irresistible.\n\n\u201cMany different groups have tested this idea that some people are more attractive than others and it\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d Dr. Vosshall said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t exactly know why.\u201d\n\nIN THE FUTURE DEET has been the go-to solution for more than 70 years, but that\u2019s changing. Last year, Dr. Ray and his colleagues revealed that they had discovered possible chemical substitutes for DEET that also have a milder smell, like that of grapes or sandalwood. Such findings will likely \u201clead to brand new, safer and more pleasant and perhaps more affordable mosquito repellents over the next two years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully in four or five years we\u2019ll find a DEET substitute that wouldn\u2019t need to be spread all over your skin and could perhaps be used as a perfume or an after-shave.\u201d\n\nEau de Aedes aegypti? Here\u2019s hoping.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on April 6, 2014, on page TR2 of the New York edition with the headline: Getting the Jump on a Tiny Foe.

They eschew Park Avenue for Canal Street, and prefer bespoke kitchens by the British designer Smallbone of Devizes to the typical Sub-Zero style. The young wealthy elite is split between entrepreneurs, who have made their fortunes in technology and business, and those who have family money. But nearly all prefer homes downtown, and they almost always pay all cash.\n\n\u201cThey have a completely different DNA from the rest of us,\u201d said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential, a brokerage that represents young tech millionaires. \u201cThey like to stay under the radar, and the time and energy others spend to conform, these people spend forging their own path. What is important to them is to have something that is not like what everyone else has.\u201d\n\nBuildings that have been currying favor among this set include the Sterling Mason in TriBeCa, 200 Eleventh Avenue in Chelsea and 285 Lafayette Street in SoHo. \u201cIn my experience smaller is better than bigger, buildings like One57 and 15 CPW are not their thing,\u201d Mr. Dankner said.\n\nTake 471 Washington Street, which began sales in 2010 and sold out before construction was completed. It is on the corner of Canal Street bordering SoHo and northern TriBeCa. Each of the nine apartments in the nine-story building, blocks from where the city Department of Sanitation is erecting an enormous garage and salt shed, boasts outdoor space, a private keyed elevator and 11-foot ceilings. At least four of the buyers in the building are under 40, including Sasha Bikoff, 26, an interior designer. Ms. Bikoff, who grew up in Manhattan, has furnished homes that include Judy Garland\u2019s former apartment at the Dakota on the Upper West Side, a former Hunnewell estate in Dover, Mass., and homes in Montauk, Amagansett and Hudson, N.Y.\n\nShe bought a sprawling one-bedroom at 471 Washington that has three levels, a 650-square-foot backyard and a large basement intended as storage, which has been transformed into an office, with tiled floors and walls painted royal blue. The main level has a kitchen and entertainment area where she exhibits her artwork, while the top floor houses her living space. Adjoining Ms. Bikoff\u2019s bedroom is an enormous walk-in-closet reminiscent of the one that Mr. Big built for an awed Carrie Bradshaw in the \u201cSex and the City\u201d movie; the space is a reinvention, first built as a second bedroom.\n\n\u201cEverything is totally private and separate from each other, sort of like a townhouse within the building,\u201d said Ariel Dagan, 25, an associate broker at Keller Williams New York City who represents Ms. Bikoff, having known her since both were children on the Upper East Side.\n\nBefore buying, Ms. Bikoff was renting a one-bedroom with a terrace in Chelsea. \u201cBut she likes to entertain and it just wasn\u2019t large enough,\u201d Mr. Dagan said, \u201cplus she wanted something with the feeling of Old New York \u2014 something super, super unique.\u201d\n\nTo find the perfect home, Ms. Bikoff and Mr. Dagan visited several listings from Chelsea all the way to the southern tip of TriBeCa. \u201cI am the type of person that will walk into Barney\u2019s in my sweatpants, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Ms. Bikoff said. \u201cBut at the same time, I am a serious buyer, and I think we went into some of these listings and they didn\u2019t take me seriously. That changed after we did the walk-throughs and they saw my comments and knowledge.\u201d\n\nWhen Ms. Bikoff first visited 471 Washington Street, it was still under construction. \u201cSasha walked in and from the first moment, looking at just four cement walls, she was like, \u2018This is it, this is what I want.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Dagan recalled. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What? I have no idea what we are even looking at.\u2019 But she had vision and the space gave her inspiration.\u201d\n\nOther residents of 471 Washington include two young brothers who each own large apartments and a stylish 30-something couple, Harsh and Purvi Padia. The Padias \u2014 he runs a hedge fund and she has an interior-design business \u2014 paid more than $17 million for the penthouse. The couple, who have a child, were featured in an episode of \u201cMillion Dollar Listing,\u201d a reality show on Bravo, expressing concern that the 4,200-square-foot unit, which comes with 4,000 square feet of outdoor space and a rooftop pool, was too small for the family of three. They ended up combining the apartment with the unit below, creating a 7,200-square-foot home.\n\n\u201cThe whole building is filled with rich young millionaires,\u201d said John Gomes, a broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, who oversaw the sales at 471 Washington Street with his partner Fredrik Eklund.\n\nWalker Tower, a 47-unit conversion on West 18th Street where a penthouse recently sold for a record-breaking $50.9 million and a two-bedroom recently went into contract for $4.2 million, has also seen an influx of young buyers. \u201cIt used to be that if you were dealing with a buyer who was under 40, it wasn\u2019t really in the luxury market,\u201d said Vickey Barron, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman and the director of sales at Walker Tower. \u201cThey were looking for a perfectly lovely apartment, but not really luxury. Now I\u2019ll see someone walk through the door and assume it is a 37-year-old broker, but it is actually a buyer, and they are looking at a listing that costs $14 million.\u201d\n\nAmong the young buyers at Walker Tower is a 30-something owner of a tech company who recently bought a two-bedroom; another resident, a 30-year-old lawyer and entrepreneur, bought a three-bedroom.\n\nBuildings like Walker Tower and 471 Washington Street lack many of the flashier amenities often featured in larger buildings, like golf simulators, giant screening rooms or basketball courts. But that is just fine. \u201cThese younger, successful individuals, they are almost too intelligent to go for the bells-and-whistles sales pitch,\u201d Ms. Barron said. \u201cInstead they want substance, they want something that is a good investment and is nice to live in.\u201d\n\nThe architect Cary Tamarkin is seeing a similar trend at two boutique condominiums he is developing in West Chelsea. The buildings, 456 West 19th Street and 508 West 24th Street, have pared down amenities and elevated prices \u2014 the cheapest unit at 508 West 24th Street is $4.15 million \u2014 and seem to be interesting buyers who are executives at technology and new-media companies.\n\n\u201cThe mind-set of wildly successful people who are under 40, if you think about what made them that kind of money, it is a pioneering, creative spirit,\u201d Mr. Tamarkin said. \u201cThey have a lot of self-confidence \u2014 they aren\u2019t relying on an address or someone\u2019s name to give them that cachet, but rather they are going on their spirit.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2014, on page RE1 of the New York edition with the headline: When Age Belies Buying Power.

And the opportunity to bring recreational activities, ecological parks, walkways, public space to the water and giving people access for the first time was really transformational. Because, you know, this water is really dirty. And you don\u2019t want to fall in the water. So there was kind of a resistance to letting kids get out on the water and use it.\n\nBELLAFANTE: Was there a pollution remediation component that went on in conjunction with this project?\n\nGANG: Well, the people that were thinking about this thought that you kind of have to simultaneously let people have access to create a constituency so that people actually care about the river. And then, in that way, they will actually be stewards of the river. So simultaneously, the E.P.A., for example, demanded that the city clean sewage water before putting it back into the river.\n\nBELLAFANTE: So your project was really the catalyst for this other one.\n\nGANG: A catalyst for the whole thing. And then parks and public space are something that we all have as common, you know, civic common areas. And so one of the parks that we worked on in Chicago was this Lincoln Park Zoo. And we made it into kind of a biodiverse place where there\u2019s lots of different animals, not just a lawn with trees, but almost like a zoo without cages. So animals would be attracted. But then people are attracted.\n\nBrownsville, for example, in New York, is a place where we just designed this Fire Rescue 2. It\u2019s a fire rescue facility. There\u2019s one per borough. And here it\u2019s about putting a publicly owned building and making it very open and visible and to help revitalize that part of the city.\n\nBELLAFANTE: I want to say for anyone in the audience who\u2019s not familiar with Brownsville, it\u2019s the poorest neighborhood in New York City, has the highest concentration of public housing. Terrible rates of crime. And what this will do to Brownsville is it really will bring something of aesthetic value into a neighborhood that is very, very desolate and very depressing. There are places you can stand in Brownsville and look 360 degrees, and you\u2019ll only see these monolithic public housing towers. Very little new development.\n\nGANG: But, you know, there is community in Brownsville. So when we started designing this, we developed a way of working with people, asking people from the community what they want to have.\n\nBELLAFANTE: And can you talk a little bit about the way you engaged firemen and what you learned about the culture and community of firemen that influenced \u2014\n\nGANG: What we really noticed was the firefighters \u2014 they\u2019re actually rescue workers, not firefighters \u2014 like to eat together, and they stay there a few days at a time. And they really develop a community. And so they have their own strong community.\n\nBut then that also makes them attractive to the neighbors. You feel like you trust a firefighter, a rescue worker. And those doors on the building are often open. And we even put a bench in the front of the building so people can actually sit there instead of taking this approach of creating a fortress, which I think is a contrast to what we see in the design of police stations.\n\nAnd so really designing this Fire Rescue 2 started me thinking about, are there ways that design could help improve the relationship between community members and police if we looked at the architecture? Not that it can solve everything. But I think, you know, maybe it can be part of that dialogue in creating \u2014 relationships between police and community members which are not just the confrontational relationships.", "summary": "The architect and founder of Studio Gang is using balconies and common areas in tall buildings to give people visual connections.", "compression": 33.9090909091, "coverage": 0.5454545455, "density": 0.6363636364, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

He was 89.\n\nThe cause was cancer, Dr. Richard Moriarty, the executor of his estate, said.\n\nMr. Duffy was a prolific composer of symphonic music and operas, with a long history of writing for the stage, television and documentary film. While still in his 20s, he was named music director of Arthur Lithgow\u2019s \u201cShakespeare Under the Stars\u201d festival at Antioch College in Ohio, responsible for providing the incidental music for its productions.\n\nHe went on to hold similar posts at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn., under John Houseman, its artistic director in the late 1950s. He wrote the scores for numerous plays both on and off Broadway, notably J. P. Donleavy\u2019s \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d and the political satire \u201cMacBird!\u201d\n\nIn 1974 the New York State Council on the Arts asked Mr. Duffy to revive a troubled new-music program called Composer in Performance, which had sputtered to a halt after five years for lack of money. Mr. Duffy proposed a new initiative that he called Meet the Composer, a more inviting, inclusive name inspired by his reading of Walt Whitman.\n\nAs director, Mr. Duffy approached concert promoters with a deal: If you program new music, Meet the Composer will send the composer to talk to the audience about the piece. Two years later, keen to reach audiences outside New York, he established Meet the Composer branches across the country.\n\n\u201cThere was a tremendous gulf between concertgoers and composers,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1990. \u201cSo when an opportunity to help other composers came up, I knew very clearly what needed to be done.\u201d Before long, the organization was supporting some 8,000 performances yearly.\n\nIn 1982 he set up underwriting to place composers in residence with American orchestras, where, in theory, they would offer advice on contemporary programming and promote the work of living composers. By 1990, 32 orchestras had composers in residence, in a variety of roles.\n\nThe program enjoyed notable successes, chief among them Horizons, the summer festivals of contemporary music that Jacob Druckman, organized at the New York Philharmonic. John Adams enjoyed a close working relationship with the San Francisco Symphony under the program. Other partnerships turned out to be less productive. Most orchestras, once the underwriting disappeared, dropped the idea.\n\n\u201cThe specific program itself was not self-supporting; that\u2019s true,\u201d Ed Harsh, who became president of Meet the Composer in 2007, told Chamber Music magazine in 2011. \u201cBut the way that the orchestra field thought of the role of a composer \u2014 whether it be a composer-in-residence or having a composer onsite for a performance at a minimum level or just a positive force in their repertoire \u2014 that absolutely changed.\u201d\n\nJohn Charles Patrick Duffy was born on June 23, 1926, in Manhattan, one of 14 children of Irish immigrant parents. He grew up in the Woodlawn neighborhood of the Bronx, where he took up the piano and drums as a teenager, sang in the church choir and played in a dance band during high school.\n\nAlthough under age, he enlisted in the Navy during World War II and saw action at the Battle of Okinawa. After being discharged, he studied composition with Henry Cowell and Solomon Rosowsky at what is now the New School and with Aaron Copland for two summers at Tanglewood.\n\nHe had eclectic tastes. Before beginning his shift as a night watchman at the B. Altman department store, he often visited jazz clubs to hear the likes of Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, and jazz would later be central to Meet the Composer.\n\n\u201cThey think that when you say Meet the Composer, it means \u2018serious\u2019 music, in quotes,\u201d he told The Times in 1990, describing his encounters with music presenters. \u201cThey don\u2019t think about the fact that what Ornette Coleman does is composition. We like to enlighten people.\u201d\n\nMr. Duffy\u2019s more than 300 compositions included several works inspired by contemporary events and personalities. He composed the second movement of \u201cConcerto for Tenor Saxophone and Concert Band\u201d in honor of the four girls killed in a 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Ala., and his opera \u201cMuhammad Ali\u201d (2000), directly addressed the boxer\u2019s political views. \u201cBlack Water,\u201d first performed in 1997, was based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel about the death in 1969 of Mary Jo Kopechne, who drowned when a car being driven by Senator Edward M. Kennedy went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, Mass.\n\nHis television scores won two Emmy awards, the first in 1980 for the NBC special \u201cA Talent for Life: Jews of the Italian Renaissance,\u201d the second in 1985 for \u201cHeritage: Civilization and the Jews,\u201d a PBS documentary narrated by the Israeli diplomat Abba Eban.\n\nMr. Duffy left Meet the Composer in 1996. After merging with the American Music Center in 2011, it was renamed New Music USA.\n\nIn 2005 he founded the John Duffy Composers Institute at the Virginia Arts Festival in Norfolk, a summer seminar to teach the basics of writing for musical theater.\n\nMr. Duffy is survived by a daughter, Maura Duffy; a brother, Charles, known as Bud; three sisters, Margaret Gruenfeldt, Virginia Rochileau and Eileen Duffy; a stepson, Mark Whitney Gilkey; a grandson; and a step-granddaughter.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on December 29, 2015, on page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: John Duffy, 89, Composer Who Aided Contemporaries.

At 8 years old in 1905 he arrived from Palermo, Sicily, and by the time he was a teenager he was earning $6 a week as a shipping clerk for the Goodman Hat Company in Lower Manhattan. Within five years, he had gotten a 33 percent pay increase as a laborer for the Gem Toy Company. The following year, he was supporting himself, making $8 a week, plus tips, as a barber.\n\nThose tips must have been pretty hefty. Or, he must have lived very frugally. Or, maybe, he was just lucky.\n\nBy June 1936, at the height of the Great Depression, he had done so well for a 38-year-old with a sixth-grade education who last held a full-time job in 1922, that for the last seven months he had been living at the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria hotel.\n\nThose biographical insights into the man, who would go on to become the powerful crime boss best known as Charles (Lucky) Luciano, were gleaned from newly digitized New York State Department of Corrections inmate records that were previously available only at the state archives in Albany.\n\nThe records, including files from Newgate in Greenwich Village (1797-1810), the first New York State penitentiary and the inspiration for the phrase \u201cup the river\u201d; Clinton (1851-1866, 1926-1939); and Sing Sing (1865-1939), will be available free to New York residents from Ancestry.com later this month.\n\nPrison records from San Quentin and Folsom, both in California, are also being digitized.\n\n\u201cFamily history is a puzzle, and some pieces are more surprising or salacious than others,\u201d said Michelle Ercanbrack, a spokeswoman for Ancestry.com. \u201cThere\u2019s something wickedly comforting in the notion that nobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nLuciano\u2019s details were recorded on Sing Sing\u2019s receiving blotter after he was sentenced in 1936 for profiting from a prostitution ring. (He had only a watch and $199.40 in cash with him when he was admitted.) The blotter describes his \u201ctrue name\u201d as Lucania. In the records, the mob boss says he occasionally attended church and attributes his crimes to \u201cinnocence.\u201d\n\nAmong others on the Sing Sing roster are Louis (Lepke) Buchalter. Described as an unemployed clerk, he was admitted in 1918 at age 18 after being convicted of grand larceny. His personal habits are described as \u201ctemperate,\u201d a condition that apparently changed as he matured. In 1944, after being convicted of murder as the head of the mob hit squad Murder Inc., he was executed at Sing Sing.\n\nRuth Snyder, who murdered her husband in 1927 in collaboration with her paramour, Judd Gray, was still listed as married when she got to Sing Sing. She describes herself as a churchgoer, though she had not regularly attended in 14 years.\n\nAs a 32-year-old self-described Queens housewife, she had no prior criminal record and is characterized as habitually \u201cmoderate,\u201d between temperate and intemperate. Her 1928 execution in the electric chair was captured in a famous Daily News photograph.\n\nCharles Chapin, a 60-year-old New York newspaper editor, was more accurately registered as a widower when he was admitted in 1919 for murdering his ailing wife; he, too, is described as habitually temperate. That description was belied by colleagues\u2019 characterizations of his bullying disposition in the newsroom, according to Andy Logan of The New Yorker.\n\n\u201cThey had known he would be involved in a murder some day,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut had always assumed he would be the victim.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on July 7, 2014, on page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Newly Digitized Records From Three New York PrisonsWill Be Available Online.

At the same time the export-dependent Japanese economy has sagged badly.\n\nEven the construction industry, the major recipient of government largess and the most important cog in the rural patronage machine, has turned against the party as 40 percent of its companies have fallen into bankruptcy over the last decade.\n\nFeeling betrayed, the remaining construction companies no longer press employees to vote for the Liberal Democrats, as they once did, industry officials said, and have stopped paying party membership dues. At a recent wedding, a construction company executive even hit a local Liberal Democratic politician over the head with a beer bottle after arguing over whether to support the party.\n\n\u201cBefore, we were like one big family, all supporting the Liberal Democratic Party,\u201d said Takao Hoshika, chairman of the prefectural construction industry association, which still officially backs the Liberal Democrats. \u201cNow, the unity is gone.\u201d\n\nThe new political alignments, like the old, have intruded into everyday relationships. Postmasters in town have stopped asking customers to vote for the Liberal Democrats. So have doctors, who used to urge their patients to back the party.\n\nHere in Matsuyama, a relaxed city of 500,000 known for its hot springs and succulent mandarin oranges, even once die-hard elements of the Liberal Democratic machine talk of giving the opposition Democratic Party a shot at governing the country.\n\n\u201cThe vote machine has stopped working,\u201d said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, the Liberal Democratic incumbent. \u201cEven when a group backs us, the regular members don\u2019t follow the leader anymore.\u201d\n\nA former chief cabinet secretary with a Harvard education, Mr. Shiozaki, 58, is an international-minded lawmaker who was widely seen as a future leader for the party. The fact that he is now in the political fight of his life, for a district that he has won four times and that his father first won in 1969, is testimony to the size of the shift against the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWhile no public opinion poll has been conducted in Matsuyama, Mr. Shiozaki admits he faces an uphill fight.\n\nOn a recent day of campaigning, Mr. Shiozaki held town hall meetings, Japanese-style, in which members of support groups sit shoeless on tatami mats while the candidate takes questions. A glance across the room revealed one of the party\u2019s challenges: only two or three non-graying heads were present. The party seems to be aging at an even faster rate than Japanese society, members say.\n\n\u201cYoung people don\u2019t want to be members of the Liberal Democratic Party anymore,\u201d said Shunnosuke Shuno, 79, who leads a neighborhood chapter.\n\nIn Ehime, the prefecture on the rural island of Shikoku where Matsuyama is located, party membership has fallen to some 30,000, a third of its peak in 1990, because of natural attrition and members\u2019 dropping out, according to the prefectural branch.\n\nYasunori Nakaya, 64, who owns a women\u2019s clothing store squeezed between the pachinko parlors and karaoke shops on one of Matsuyama\u2019s roofed shopping arcades, said he remained loyal to the Liberal Democrats. But both his wife and his eldest son had switched to opposition parties. So had about half of the 100 or so shop owners on his arcade, who were solidly Liberal Democratic in the last lower house election four years ago.\n\nHe blames the party\u2019s failure to fix the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIf we keep going like this, Japan will sink,\u201d Mr. Nakaya said.\n\nStill, it remains difficult for many residents in this tightly knit rural community to so openly break ranks and support the opposition.\n\nTakako Nagae, 49, the opposition Democratic Party\u2019s candidate for the Aug. 30 election, said that many former Liberal Democratic Party supporters, including doctors, truck drivers and laundry store owners, have been calling her offices to say that they secretly support her.\n\n\u201cThey back us from the shadows,\u201d said Ms. Nagae, a cheerfully charismatic former television show hostess.\n\nStill, Ms. Nagae had no trouble drawing a crowd at one of Matsuyama\u2019s long shopping arcades one recent morning with her message of reining in Tokyo\u2019s bureaucracy and giving more power to local governments. One listener, Sayoko Kinoshita, 72, said she was a lifelong backer of the Liberal Democrats. But in this election, she was giving the opposition serious consideration.\n\n\u201cMs. Nagae says such good things. I want to take these 40 days to consider both sides,\u201d she said, referring to the days then remaining until the election.\n\nIndeed, the apparent success of Ms. Nagae\u2019s photogenic style underscores an underlying sea change in Japanese politics that could also help decide this election: a shift toward campaigns driven by popular appeal instead of political patronage.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is making direct appeals via the TV,\u201d said Minoru Shinohara, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s Ehime prefectural chapter. \u201cThe vote-gathering machines are becoming a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Eroding Rural Base Threatens to Topple Japanese Party\u2019s Long Rule.

As the violence reaches deadlier peaks, attention has shifted to armed rebel groups, which have become the most prominent face of a rebellion that started almost 18 months ago with street protests.\n\n\u201cFrance asks the Syrian opposition to form a provisional government \u2014 inclusive and representative \u2014 that can become the legitimate representative of the new Syria,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cWe are including our Arab partners to accelerate this step,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cFrance will recognize the provisional government of Syria once it is formed.\u201d\n\nThe French leader also reiterated a warning made by President Obama a week ago, seconded a few days later by Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, that military intervention could be justified if the Syrian government used unconventional weapons or moved them in a threatening fashion. Syria has said that it would use such weapons only in the event of an external attack.\n\nMr. Hollande also confirmed that France was working with other countries on the possibility of establishing \u201cbuffer zones\u201d inside Syria, presumably if the opposition forces can create them. The zones, formally to protect refugees, were an idea floated by Turkey, which has resisted suggestions that it use its own forces to invade Syria and create such zones for the Free Syrian Army and other rebels.\n\nThe French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has already spoken of possible \u201cno-fly zones\u201d over Syrian territory, from the Turkish border to Aleppo, to protect refugees, but he has provided no further details. He said the idea originated with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and was being studied.\n\nMr. Hollande also said that France continued to press the Security Council for a new, more far-reaching resolution on Syria and criticized Russia and China for using their vetoes to protect Mr. Assad. He said that their \u201cattitude is weakening our capacity to ensure the United Nations Charter is respected.\u201d\n\nHis comments came as some of the war\u2019s deadliest violence remained focused on the outskirts of Damascus. In Daraya, southwest of the capital, opposition activists have accused the government of killing hundreds of people over the last week.\n\nIn recent days, residents have spoken of a brutal \u201ccleansing\u201d operation by the military, deploying helicopters, heavy artillery and tanks to dislodge a large contingent of rebel fighters who had made Daraya a stronghold. Mass burials were held on Sunday for victims, who included women and children.\n\nRefugees from Daraya who reached Lebanon on Monday spoke of bodies lying on residential streets and town squares, and a city choked by the smell of death. A 17-year-old refugee who fled with her family said that many of the dead were rebel fighters, but many other victims, like her uncle, who she claimed had no ties to the rebels, were civilians seized by government troops who later turned up dead, she said.\n\nHer uncle, a 40-year-old bus driver, was taken by soldiers last Monday as he walked neighbors to a bomb shelter, she said. The next day, his body was found with knife and bullet wounds. His family, too frightened to attend his funeral, found a picture of his corpse on the Internet.

Family members spoke to news agency reporters in Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, and said that they and defense lawyers had not been allowed into the courtroom.\n\nThe Irrawaddy Web site, which is based in neighboring Thailand, listed the names of 14 advocates it said were sentenced to the 65-year terms.\n\nSome of the advocates were reported to be veterans of a 1988 pro-democracy uprising that nearly succeeded in toppling the military leaders in Myanmar, formerly Burma. The advocates were arrested in August 2007 in the early stages of protests that swelled later into mass demonstrations led by monks that were violently put down.\n\nRelatives of the advocates said they were convicted under a wide range of laws, like the Foreign Exchange Act, which bans Burmese from holding foreign currency without permission. Other laws reportedly used were the Video Act and the Electronics Act, which require Burmese to hold permits for various types of ordinary electronic equipment.\n\nOne of the best-known examples of the use of these laws was the sentencing in 1996 of James Nichols, an honorary consul for Norway, to three years for possession of a fax machine without a permit in his Yangon home.

Accused of beating his girlfriend and threatening her with a knife, he was offered a plea deal of two years plus probation by the prosecutor. Mr. Guthrie rejected that, and a later offer of five years. More Photos \u00bb\n\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 After decades of new laws to toughen sentencing for criminals, prosecutors have gained greater leverage to extract guilty pleas from defendants and reduce the number of cases that go to trial, often by using the threat of more serious charges with mandatory sentences or other harsher penalties.\n\nSome experts say the process has become coercive in many state and federal jurisdictions, forcing defendants to weigh their options based on the relative risks of facing a judge and jury rather than simple matters of guilt or innocence. In effect, prosecutors are giving defendants more reasons to avoid having their day in court.\n\n\u201cWe now have an incredible concentration of power in the hands of prosecutors,\u201d said Richard E. Myers II, a former assistant United States attorney who is now an associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina. He said that so much influence now resides with prosecutors that \u201cin the wrong hands, the criminal justice system can be held hostage.\u201d\n\nOne crucial, if unheralded, effect of this shift is now coming into sharper view, according to academics who study the issue. Growing prosecutorial power is a significant reason that the percentage of felony cases that go to trial has dropped sharply in many places.\n\nPlea bargains have been common for more than a century, but lately they have begun to put the trial system out of business in some courtrooms. By one count, fewer than one in 40 felony cases now make it to trial, according to data from nine states that have published such records since the 1970s, when the ratio was about one in 12. The decline has been even steeper in federal district courts.\n\nCases like Florida v. Shane Guthrie help explain why. After Mr. Guthrie, 24, was arrested here last year, accused of beating his girlfriend and threatening her with a knife, the prosecutor offered him a deal for two years in prison plus probation.\n\nMr. Guthrie rejected that, and a later offer of five years, because he believed that he was not guilty, his lawyer said. But the prosecutor\u2019s response was severe: he filed a more serious charge that would mean life imprisonment if Mr. Guthrie is convicted later this year.\n\nBecause of a state law that increased punishments for people who had recently been in prison, like Mr. Guthrie, the sentence would be mandatory. So what he could have resolved for a two-year term could keep him locked up for 50 years or more.\n\nThe decrease in trials has also been a consequence of underfinanced public defense lawyers who can try only a handful of their cases, as well as, prosecutors say, the rise of drug courts and other alternative resolutions.\n\nThe overloaded court system has also seen comparatively little expansion in many places, making a huge increase in plea bargains a cheap and easy way to handle a near-tripling in felony cases over the past generation.\n\nBut many researchers say the most important force in driving down the trial rate has been state and federal legislative overhauls that imposed mandatory sentences and other harsher and more certain penalties for many felonies, especially those involving guns, drugs, violent crimes and repeat offenders.\n\nStiffer punishments were also put in place for specific crimes, like peddling drugs near a school or wearing a mask in certain circumstances. And legislators added reams of new felony statutes, vastly expanding the range of actions considered illegal.\n\nThese tougher penalties, by many accounts, have contributed to the nation\u2019s steep drop in crime the past two decades. They have also swelled the prison population to levels that lawmakers in some states say they can no longer afford, and a few have rolled back some laws.\n\nIn the courtroom and during plea negotiations, the impact of these stricter laws is exerted through what academics call the \u201ctrial penalty.\u201d The phrase refers to the fact that the sentences for people who go to trial have grown harsher relative to sentences for those who agree to a plea.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, this gap has widened so much it has become coercive and is used to punish defendants for exercising their right to trial, some legal experts say.", "summary": "Empowered by years of tough sentencing-law changes in state legislatures and Congress, prosecutors have more muscle to extract guilty pleas from defendants and avoid trial.", "compression": 29.3793103448, "coverage": 0.7931034483, "density": 2.4482758621, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

The round-trip tickets, which her daughter paid for, cost between $190 and $230. \u201cI actually saved them a lot of money,\u201d Ms. Tepper said. Her daughter later made partner in her consulting firm.\n\nEven at a time when grandparents are more involved than ever in the lives of their children and grandchildren, the efforts of Mrs. Kim and Ms. Tepper are extraordinary. But many grandparents these days are making extreme efforts to help their children bridge the work-life divide.\n\n\u201cTo me, grandparents are like the family National Guard,\u201d said Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University who studies intergenerational issues. \u201cThey are ready to step in when there is a need, and as soon as that need is met, they are ready to leave active duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn low-income families,\u201d he continued, \u201cit may be the grandmother down the street who helps out. In high-income families, it is the grandmother in a neighboring city who helps out.\u201d\n\nIntercity commuting is just one way they provide that help. Grandparents are also taking time off from work, retiring early, moving to the United States from overseas or selling their home to be near grandchildren.\n\nThe greater involvement results from a confluence of factors, including the financial burdens of child care and anxiety over the quality of care. But most notably it is influenced by a generation of grandparents who have the time and the financial wherewithal to pitch in.\n\n\u201cThis is the first generation where we have so many older people living long enough, being healthy enough and being affluent enough to provide these services on a large scale\u201d since women entered the workplace in large numbers, Dr. Cherlin said.\n\nBut the involvement cuts across the economic spectrum. According to the census, 19.4 percent of preschool children with working mothers were primarily entrusted to grandparents in 2002, the latest year for which there are statistics. Grandparents took charge more often than fathers (18.2 percent), day care (19 percent) or hired help (9 percent). In 1995, grandparents ranked third behind fathers and day care centers, at 15.9 percent.\n\nThere are no figures on how many grandparents go to extremes, because they can afford to, to care for their children\u2019s children.\n\n\u201cWe call them grandboomers,\u201d said Amy Goyer, national coordinator for the AARP Foundation Grandparent Information Center, which has noticed heightened interest in information and services for grandparents. \u201cThey have more disposable income. They may have planned better for retirement.\u201d\n\nFor example, Judy Chen of Seattle could afford to take a year off as a hospital researcher to move to the Bay Area to baby-sit to help her daughter, a corporate lawyer. Her career was better able to absorb the timeout, she said: She was close to retirement, but her daughter was on a fairly strict career track in her firm.\n\n\u201cCompared with her job, I have to sacrifice a little bit,\u201d Mrs. Chen said.\n\nBesides, she said, echoing a sentiment expressed in similar terms by other Asian and Latino grandparents interviewed, \u201cI am a Chinese mother.\u201d Stepping in \u2014 even moving in \u2014 is customary in cultures that stress intergenerational familial obligations. In Mrs. Chen\u2019s case, her sense of obligation to her daughter trumps that to her husband, who was left home alone for a year. \u201cHe is lonely, but he has a job,\u201d Mrs. Chen said.\n\nMrs. Chen\u2019s daughter and son-in-law were reluctant to hire a nanny, feeling uncomfortable with strangers raising their son. They said they also worry about day care, expressing a widely shared parental anxiety that was only heightened by a National Institutes of Health study published this year that found some evidence of increased behavior problems among sixth graders the more time they had spent in professional day care.\n\nWere it not for the help of her mother and mother-in-law, Andrea Kim said, she would have quit her residency rather than put Noah in day care two years ago.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it,\u201d said Andrea Kim, who had already invested nine years in college, medical school and a residency at that point. \u201cI had a lot of guilt.\u201d\n\nAnd so she proposed the flying granny nanny scenario to her mother. \u201cIt was a joke when I first mentioned it, then it turned into a plea,\u201d Andrea Kim said.\n\nSome weeks, her mother or her father, Augustine, 61, fly to Dallas, scoop Noah up at the airport curbside pickup and take him to Houston on the next flight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Mrs. Kim, the grandmother. \u201cSomehow it works out.\u201d\n\nAs for the expense, the family waits for an e-mail alert that Southwest is offering a sale, then buys $1,000 worth of tickets. It\u2019s still expensive, but less so than professional child care, which would cost her daughter and her husband, Tim, $160 to $200 a week.\n\nNoah\u2019s other grandmother, Nita Thomason, who lives in the Dallas area, watches him for another three days of the week.\n\nMrs. Kim was initially reluctant to take on the burden; she was very busy volunteering for her Southern Baptist church. But then she realized that her daughter was serious. \u201cShe was desperate,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a mother, I thought, \u2018She needs my help more than any other time of her life, and this is something I can do for her.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTed Curtis, 62, said that his daughter Beth Horowicz, a corporate lawyer, also didn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving her daughter, Addison, in day care. \u201cShe never really adapted,\u201d he said of Addison, who was painfully shy and often clung to her mother\u2019s leg.\n\nSo a few years ago, Ted and his wife, Laurie, retired, sold their house in Maine and moved in with Beth and her husband, Ben, outside Baltimore to help raise Addison. The Horowiczes bought a new house for the extended family. The grandparents\u2019 presence has changed Addison, coaxing her out of her shell. \u201cIt took a while to get her to open up, and now she talks and talks and talks,\u201d Mr. Curtis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different child.\u201d\n\nThe Curtises were eager to be closer to their grandchildren, as their children are scattered across the country. \u201cIt was hard to be distant grandparents up in Maine,\u201d said Mrs. Curtis, who now baby-sits for another granddaughter in Baltimore as well.\n\nSome grandparents find lending a hand fulfilling. Kay Govoni of Burlington, Mass., retired 10 years ago so she could take care of her grandchildren full time.\n\n\u201cI do think that a lot of people my age are beginning to see that, O.K., we\u2019ve retired, and so what do you do with your life: spend it all in a selfish let\u2019s-go-play, let\u2019s-go to-Florida, let\u2019s-go-out-to-dinner lifestyle?\u201d she said. \u201cThat gets old hat very fast.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, being a grandparent is an extension of being a parent. Mrs. Kim said, \u201cMy friends ask me, \u2018Is this for the grandbaby?\u2019 I thought about it and I know it\u2019s more about my child than my grandbaby.\u201d\n\nMrs. Curtis said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard on young women now. They\u2019re expected to do what my generation dreamed of doing.\u201d\n\nAnd, she said, she believes it is her duty to help her daughters fulfill the ambitions she herself encouraged. \u201cI feel like I am responsible to some extent that they are pursuing the professions they have,\u201d she said.\n\nBeth Horowicz is grateful to the Curtises for keeping the household running by cooking dinners, doing the laundry and sending the thank-you cards. \u201cThey are the glue that holds things together,\u201d said Mrs. Horowicz, who, thanks to them, even has the luxury of a morning run.\n\nBen Horowicz said that when he mentioned to friends that his in-laws were moving with them, \u201cIt would be followed by a moment of silence.\u201d But over time, his peers have changed their opinion, he said. \u201cA number of friends have expressed jealousy that we seem to have a manageable existence.\u201d", "summary": "Some affluent retirees don\u2019t mind dropping in by air to baby-sit.", "compression": 111.7333333333, "coverage": 0.7333333333, "density": 1.5333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

The Mass was broadcast live on national television, and the government declared Friday a day of national mourning. At a news conference after the funeral, Prime Minister Berlusconi said that \u201cpeople have been asking me, \u2018Please don\u2019t leave us alone.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI made a promise to them in front of their coffins,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has assumed this responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe said that more than 1,300 members of Italy\u2019s security forces were patrolling the area to prevent looting.\n\nMeanwhile, the Italian news media reported that the prosecutor of L\u2019Aquila planned to open an investigation into building practices in the area, including the possible use of weak cement.\n\nAftershocks have damaged buildings in medieval towns and unnerved many of the 17,000 survivors living in tent villages.\n\nThousands of others displaced by the earthquake are staying in hotels on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMr. Berlusconi said the government would draw up a list of damaged monuments that foreign countries could help to restore.

That idea may be hard to accept in the United States. After all, it was the decade of 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the financial crisis, all dramatic and painful events. But in economic terms, at least, the decade was a remarkably good one for many people around the globe.\n\nThe raging economic growth rates of China and India are well known, though their rise is part of a broader trend in the economic development of poorer countries. Ideals of prosperity, freedom and the rule of law have probably never been more resonant globally than they\u2019ve been over the last 10 years, even if practice often falls short. And for all of the anticapitalistic rhetoric that has emerged from the financial crisis, national leaders around the world are embracing the commercialization of their economies.\n\nPutting aside the United States, which ranks third, the four most populous countries are China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, accounting for more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s people. And all four have made great strides. Indonesia had solid economic growth during the entire decade, mostly in the 5 to 6 percent annual range. That came after its very turbulent 1990s, marked by a disastrous financial crisis and plummeting standards of living.\n\nBrazil also had a consistently good decade, with growth at times exceeding 5 percent a year. There is lots of talk that the country has finally turned the corner, and, within its borders, there is major worry that its currency is too strong \u0097 a problem that many other countries would envy.\n\nElsewhere in South America, Colombia and Peru have made enormous progress and Chile is on the verge of becoming a \u201cdeveloped\u201d country; it will soon be joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nTo be sure, in Africa, there is still enormous misery. Nonetheless, overall standards of living rose in a wide variety of countries there, with economic growth for the continent as a whole at more than 5 percent in most years. Many basic essentials, like water, sanitation, electricity and especially telephones, are more commonly available.\n\nOne lesson from all of this is that steady economic growth is an underreported news story \u0097 and to our own detriment. As human beings, we are prone to focus on very dramatic, visible events, such as confrontations with political enemies or the personal qualities of leaders, whether good or bad. We turn information about politics and economics into stories of good guys versus bad guys and identify progress with the triumph of the good guys. In the process, it\u2019s easy to neglect the underlying forces that improve life in small, hard-to-observe ways, culminating in important changes.\n\nIn a given year, an extra percentage point of economic growth may not seem to matter much. But, over time, the difference between annual growth of 1 percent and 2 percent determines whether you can double your standard of living every 35 years or every 70 years. At 5 percent annual economic growth, living standards double about every 14 years.\n\nNonetheless, despite the positive news in much of the world, it\u2019s questionable whether the decade as a whole has been good for Americans, economically speaking. Median wages have not risen much, if at all, and the costs of the financial crisis and irresponsible fiscal policies have become increasingly obvious. Those facts support a pessimistic interpretation.\n\nStill, most economic models suggest that the fundamental source of growth is new ideas, which enable us to produce more from a given set of resources. To the extent that the rest of the world becomes wealthier, there\u2019s more innovation, as my colleague and co-blogger Alex Tabarrok, professor of economics at George Mason University, argued recently. China, for instance, is moving toward the research frontier in areas such as solar power, scientific instruments, engineering and nanoscience, all of which can benefit the United States. Unlike the situation of just a few decades ago, a genius born in Mumbai now stands a good chance of becoming a notable scientist, whether at home or abroad.\n\nIt might be pleasant to boast that America is \u0097 or should be \u0097 a world leader in every area, but the practical reality is that if some other country solves the problem of green energy, so much the better for us.\n\nThe subtler point is that a wealthier China, India, Brazil and Indonesia will lead to more customers for new innovations, thereby producing greater rewards for successful entrepreneurs, no matter where they live. There are so many improvements in cellphones these days because there are so many cellphone customers in so many countries.\n\nTO put it bluntly, if the United States takes one step back and the rest of the world takes two steps forward, even in purely selfish terms we should consider accepting the trade-off, if only for the longer run. Most of us gain from the wealth and creativity of other countries, even if we can\u2019t always feel like the top dog.\n\nWhen asked what he thought of the French Revolution, Zhou Enlai, the premier of China from 1949 until his death in 1976, reportedly replied, \u201cIt is too soon to tell.\u201d\n\nThat is also a fair response to the last 10 years, and it will be for some time to come. The point remains that if we look beneath the surface just a bit, the picture is a good deal rosier than we might otherwise think.\n\nTyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.", "summary": "For China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, which have more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s people, the decade was one of solid economic growth.", "compression": 36.2666666667, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 5.8666666667, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary_and_strapline", "annotator": "3"}

Endless upkeep? Endless spending on new rides? Endless anxiety about public safety?\n\nThanks, but no thanks. Some analysts predicted a speedy sale.\n\nInstead, Comcast did a public about face, identifying Universal Orlando in particular as a growth engine and spending $100 million to build a \u201cTransformers\u201d ride here in 2013. Still, there was skepticism. Was Comcast becoming a new theme park force? Competitors insisted the jury was still out.\n\nWell, the verdict just came in: Comcast is pouring billions into Universal Orlando and a sister property in California, opening major attractions and resort hotels at breakneck speed and visitors are flooding the gates as a result. Attendance increased 10.4 percent last year, with Universal parks generating 40.2 million turnstile clicks. For the first half of this year, NBCUniversal\u2019s theme park unit had operating cash flow of $617 million, a 49 percent increase from the same period a year ago.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a huge, huge number for a business this size,\u201d Stephen B. Burke, NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive and senior executive vice president of Comcast, said on a July 23 conference call with analysts. \u201cWe see this as a major growth driver for the company for five, 10, 15, 20 years.\u201d\n\nBut now Comcast faces a new question: Is it moving too fast and disregarding the perennial problems that have long challenged this corner of entertainment?\n\nHere at Universal Orlando, an 800-acre resort that includes two theme parks, four hotels and an outdoor CityWalk mall, a vast amount of construction is underway. Four cranes towered last month over a site that will become Volcano Bay, a new water park. A few hundred feet away, six cranes toiled over an even bigger site marked Project 664. Rising from the ground there is a $300 million hotel called Sapphire Falls, which Universal hopes will strengthen its conference business.\n\nMore hotel rooms are on the way a lot more. Mr. Burke has said that Universal Orlando, which will have 5,200 hotel rooms after Sapphire Falls opens next year, could have 10,000 rooms and still maintain profitable occupancy levels.\n\nSince 2013, Universal Orlando has opened rides themed to \u201cTransformers,\u201d \u201cDespicable Me\u201d and the Harry Potter movies. A major \u201cKing Kong\u201d attraction will arrive next summer. In the works are attractions based on the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d films, \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d Hello Kitty and Nintendo video games. Over at the CityWalk shopping district where eight new restaurants have opened over the last two years an NBC Sports Grill & Brew pub is on the way, complete with 100 televisions.\n\nAnd that is just in Orlando. Under the guidance of Ron Meyer, NBCUniversal\u2019s vice chairman, the company\u2019s California outpost is undergoing a $1.6 billion expansion anchored by a snow-capped Hogwarts Castle. Universal is also building a $3.25 billion park in Beijing in partnership with a consortium of Chinese companies; it is slated to open in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep our foot on the pedal as far as it will go,\u201d Tom Williams, chairman of Universal Parks and Resorts, said in an interview. \u201cAny chance we get to pour the gas directly into the carburetor, we\u2019ll do that too.\u201d\n\nAdd in the billions Disney is spending to expand its own empire the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort opens next year and megawatt \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d additions are coming to Disney outposts in Florida and perhaps the biggest theme park building boom in history is underway, analysts say. It is a remarkable turnaround for a business that became a backwater in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when attendance dropped sharply.\n\nBut with increased investment in theme parks comes increased risk. Theme parks will always be sensitive to swings in the economy. Another challenge involves managing visitor expectations; training them to expect something new every summer will eventually disappoint. Analysts point out that, despite an extraordinary safety record, these teeming resorts could become relative ghost towns overnight if a park anywhere in the world became a target for violence.\n\nDisneyland in Anaheim, Calif., recently endured a public-relations nightmare when it became linked to an outbreak of measles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great business,\u201d said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cYou\u2019re always pouring money into them. It\u2019s relatively low return. And when you have a downturn in the economy, they typically get hit pretty hard.\u201d\n\nStill, theme parks, at least for the moment, are a reliable business. Last year, the Universal parks were significantly more profitable for NBCUniversal than movies or broadcast television. \u201cComcast\u2019s stock price is driven by growth, and the parks, while a small piece of Comcast over all, have become an outsized contributor to its growth,\u201d said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS.\n\nWhile still delivering huge returns, cable television has started to sputter with ratings erosion. NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, for instance, generated $872 million in operating cash flow in the most recent quarter, a 4.6 percent decline from a year ago. The movie business, meanwhile, remains challenged by piracy, diminishing DVD sales and rising marketing costs.\n\n\u201cTechnology is changing so quickly it\u2019s hard to predict how many people 30 years from now will be watching linear television or movies with Oculus glasses, but I feel strongly that for decades to come families are going to want the experience of having fun together at one of our theme parks,\u201d Mr. Burke said in an interview.\n\nUniversal expanded into Florida in 1979 with the purchase of 312 acres of \u201cpalmetto scrub and swamp,\u201d recalled Mr. Williams, who has worked for Universal and its various parent companies (MCA, Matsushita, Seagram, Vivendi, General Electric, Comcast) for more than 40 years. With an emphasis on thrill rides, Universal became a force among teenagers and young adults when it finally opened its gates here in 1990.\n\nBut Universal\u2019s parks, suffering from underinvestment as owners came and went, \u201cwere in an attendance death spiral\u201d by 2000, according to Sam Gennawey, the author of \u201cUniversal vs. Disney: The Unofficial Guide to American Theme Parks\u2019 Greatest Rivalry.\u201d\n\nWorking with J. K. Rowling, Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, the company\u2019s theme park design group, created an immersive 20-acre \u201cland\u201d in Orlando dedicated to Ms. Rowling\u2019s wizarding world. The $265 million addition, complete with Butterbeer carts and Ollivanders, an interactive wand shop, opened in mid-2010 and became a smash hit demonstrating to Comcast that Universal Creative, if properly funded, could be a best-in-class operation.\n\nNow Comcast is speeding ahead a Harry Potter expansion, featuring a working Hogwarts Express train, opened in 2014 in large part because of Mr. Burke\u2019s confidence in Mr. Woodbury. To create the new water park, Volcano Bay, Mr. Woodbury said he sent his team on an around-the-world tour of existing water parks. \u201cWe want to build something that is totally groundbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the state of the art and how can we surpass that?\u201d\n\nUniversal sees a competitive opening in Orlando, which is dominated by Disney World. Located about 20 minutes to the south, Disney World dwarfs Universal in size and popularity. But navigating such a giant resort Disney uses a fleet of buses and a monorail to move guests around it can be daunting. Disney, which recently spent $1 billion on a reservation and navigation system to make Disney World more convenient, declined to comment for this article.\n\n\u201cWe are user friendly,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIf visitors notice what we\u2019re doing here and decide to spend a day or two less at a competing resort, hip hip hooray.\u201d", "summary": "After Comcast bought NBCUniversal four years ago, it surprised some by not only hanging onto the company\u2019s theme parks, but investing heavily in their expansion.", "compression": 53.3793103448, "coverage": 0.724137931, "density": 1.8965517241, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

That was my life\u2019s service. This is my life\u2019s experience.\u201d\n\nThe question of Mr. Carson\u2019s fitness for the presidency certainly has more to do with his professional experience and policy ideas than what he experienced as a child.\n\nAll this mythmaking is a politician\u2019s way of showing authenticity. But it\u2019s now time to press these candidates harder on their own records and so-far vague proposals on jobs and taxes, education and crime than on how many miles they walked to school as children. What\u2019s past is past, as Grandma would say.

At the same time, viewers are able to see the 36-by-33-foot model as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe word is not in our vocabulary,\u201d said Ms. Kalker in accented English in a telephone interview from Spain, where the group was on tour. \u201cWe are making a live animation film onstage.\u201d\n\nYet \u201cKamp,\u201d which mixes theater, music, video, sculpture and puppetry, is scheduled for six performances this week starting on Wednesday as part of the Toy Theater Festival at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn. The festival celebrates miniature and puppet theaters, a popular 19th-century art form, from around the world. Ms. Kalker and her partners Arl\u00e8ne Hoornweg and Herman Helle arrived in New York over the holiday weekend to set up the \u201cKamp\u201d scale model, a process that typically takes two days.\n\nThe 1986 publication of \u201cMaus,\u201d Art Spiegelman\u2019s acclaimed graphic novel, in which Jews were portrayed as mice and Nazis as cats, helped pave the way for Holocaust stories to be told in genres that once might have been seen as too idiosyncratic or irreverent.\n\nMs. Kalker said that after mounting a critically acclaimed 2001 show about World War I that featured miniature figures, she realized that the company could approach Auschwitz similarly without lapsing into clich\u00e9. \u201cOur medium had a special way of telling the war theme,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Helle, who designed the models, said he started with one figure and one barracks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know exactly what story we could tell,\u201d he said. He then made 100 puppets, but the three partners realized that was not enough. He made 300; still not enough. Even after making 3,000, he said, they recognized they could only present a fraction of the total picture.\n\nThe small figures are made of wire with heads of Plasticine, a clay that hardens when baked. The expressions \u0097 from poked-in eyes, noses and mouths \u0097 are frozen in Munch-like howls. The prisoners wear black-and-white-striped cloth. For the guards and the new trainloads of arrivals, Mr. Helle photocopied old photographs, cut out the clothes and hats and glued them on.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for an easy and fast way to make them,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Helle made the translucent bodies of the naked, gassed prisoners out of hot glue that melted around wire frames. \u201cIt makes them look very vulnerable,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout 10 visual artists helped with the models. The whole project took about eight months to construct.\n\nThe complete installation, made mostly of plain gray corrugated cardboard, includes barracks, guard towers, crematoriums, gas chambers with buckets of gas pellets, a dining hall for the guards, a train and tracks, and the notorious gateway sign, \u201cArbeit Macht Frei,\u201d \u201cWork Makes You Free.\u201d\n\nAt performances of \u201cKamp,\u201d the three artists move the figures around the set. The tiny puppets sweep, shovel rocks and line up to be counted. Prisoners are beaten and executed by hanging; others are gassed; corpses are buried or burned. Using a small camera, Mr. Helle films the figures in a tight frame, projecting the images in close-up on the wall of the theater.\n\nThe audience is seated around the model, as if looking down at the camp from a mountainside. \u201cAll the time you have an overview,\u201d Ms. Kalker explained, \u201cand with the camera, we give you an insider\u2019s view of what is happening in the camp. We want to make the audience eyewitnesses.\u201d\n\nHotel Modern experimented with different methods of storytelling. The artists tried working with a script. One idea was to have a Mengele-like doctor performing medical experiments.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work at all,\u201d Mr. Helle said. \u201cIt was too much like a history lesson.\u201d\n\nAnother idea was to have a group of women talk about food and cooking, or have a Nazi official visit. Those proposals were also scrapped.\n\nThe nearly hourlong show has no dialogue, but there is sound from small microphones, which amplify the sweeping, and from the miniaturized railway, as well as added recorded effects that include the sounds of wind, swallows, industrial clanging and a screeching squeak from a cart that Mr. Helle taped while visiting Auschwitz itself.\n\nMs. Kalker, whose grandfather died at the camp, said she invited Holocaust survivors, including her cousin Ralph Prins, a sculptor, to see early versions of \u201cKamp.\u201d \u201cI asked him to see it, if he thought it was appropriate,\u201d Ms. Kalker said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted their approval,\u201d she said of the survivors.\n\nThe work has received good reviews, except in Germany, where \u201cKamp\u201d provoked a mixed response. Ms. Kalker said she thought Germans were still figuring out how to deal with this part of their history. Critics complained that \u201cusing puppets was making it seem banal,\u201d she said, or they thought \u201cit was in bad taste.\u201d Responding to that point, she noted that Auschwitz and other camps have miniature models of their original layouts today in their visitors\u2019 centers.\n\nFor their performances in Spain last week , Hotel Modern showed a different piece, called \u201cShrimp Tales.\u201d It is a comedy starring 400 prawns, who play human beings eating in restaurants; attending church, a wedding and a funeral; playing the piano; boxing; giving birth; performing surgery; lining up for an episode of \u201cAntiques Roadshow\u201d; and landing on the moon.\n\n\u201cWe have a humorous side,\u201d Ms. Kalker said. \u201cI would not want to perform only \u2018Kamp.\u2019 \u201d", "summary": "Hotel Modern, a Dutch theater group, uses a miniature scale model of Auschwitz to bring a story of horror to life at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse.", "compression": 41.7931034483, "coverage": 0.9310344828, "density": 1.9655172414, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

When officers fell to the ground to take cover from gunfire, they detonated the explosives.\n\n\u201cSomething has gone very wrong,\u201d said Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, according to the news agency Press Trust of India. \u201cI am deeply shocked.\u201d\n\nHe said the attack by the Maoist fighters showed the \u201cbrutality and the savagery they are capable of.\u201d\n\nThe attack comes as the government is mobilizing security forces against the Maoists in a multistate campaign known as Operation Green Hunt. The Maoists, also known as Naxalites, have existed in India for four decades and claim to represent the interests of the rural dispossessed who have not shared in India\u2019s economic progress. Once lightly regarded by the government, the Maoists have expanded across a large rural corridor and now exercise outright control over some isolated mountain regions. Maoist propaganda calls for overthrowing the Indian state.\n\nThe goal of the government operation is to push the Maoists out of more populated rural areas and isolate them in certain remote mountain regions. Maoist sympathizers have accused the government of brutalizing and killing innocent villagers as security forces sweep through rural areas to root out rebel fighters.\n\nOfficials say the Maoists are the ones who brutalize, having disrupted schools and hospitals and destroyed roads in many areas; the security campaign calls for clearing areas of rebels so that government services can be restored.\n\nBy some unofficial estimates, roughly 200 security officers have been killed by Maoists during the past 12 months. The operation involves multiple federal and state security agencies, and some analysts have questioned whether poor coordination and training is exposing officers to danger. On Sunday, Maoists detonated a land mine in the state of Orissa, killing 10 officers and wounding 16 others. And in February, about 100 Maoists on motorcycles stormed a police outpost in the state of West Bengal, killing 24 security officers.\n\nThe attack on Tuesday occurred in the Dantewada region in the state of Chhattisgarh, in an area known as Chintalnar, considered a major Maoist stronghold. The officers were members of the Central Reserve Police Force, a paramilitary unit, who entered the forest on Sunday night for a two-day mission related to the government operation.\n\nT. J. Longkumar, the Chhattisgarh police inspector general for the larger region, said the officers were returning to camp after an early morning patrol when the Maoists struck around 6:30 a.m. Indian news outlets reported that as many as 1,000 Maoists were involved.\n\n\u201cThey were blasted,\u201d Officer Longkumar said. \u201cMost of the casualties were from the explosives.\u201d\n\nHe said the attack was probably a response to security forces pressing deeper into isolated areas once completely controlled by the Maoists. \u201cThey have regrouped,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel we are entering their core area.\u201d", "summary": "The authorities described a carefully executed surprise attack in an isolated forest region on Tuesday.", "compression": 37.1875, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 6.375, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

As China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next president, Mr. Xi is unlikely to be as robotic as his predecessor, Hu Jintao.\n\nHERE is my prediction about China: The new paramount leader, Xi Jinping, will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao\u2019s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison.\n\nThese won\u2019t happen immediately \u2014 Xi won\u2019t even be named president until March \u2014 and I may be wrong entirely. But my hunch on this return to China, my old home, is that change is coming.\n\nHere\u2019s my case for Xi as a reformer.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s in his genes. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a pioneer of economic restructuring and publicly denounced the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Xi\u2019s mother chooses to live in Shenzhen, the most capitalist enclave in the country.\n\nXi is also one of the first Chinese leaders to send a child to the United States as an undergraduate. His daughter is a junior at Harvard, reflecting her parents\u2019 emphasis on learning English and their admiration for American education.\n\nIt helps that the bar is low for Xi: he follows President Hu Jintao, who is widely regarded in China as a failure. Even government ministers complain that he squandered his 10 years as leader. Today there is pent-up demand for change.\n\nPresident Hu, who always reads speeches from texts, is a robot who surrounds himself with robots. One such robot aide is Ling Jihua, whose 23-year-old son was driving a Ferrari one night last March with two half-naked women as passengers. The car crashed on a Beijing road, killing the young man and badly injuring the women, one of whom later died.\n\nLing feared a scandal and reportedly began a cover-up. He went to the morgue, according to the account I got from one Chinese official, and looked at the body \u2014 and then coldly denied that it was his son. He continued to work in the following weeks as if nothing had happened. The cover-up failed, and the episode underscored all that was wrong with the old leadership: the flaunting of dubious wealth, the abuse of power and the lack of any heart.\n\nXi is trying to send a message that he is different. His first act upon becoming Communist Party general secretary in November was to replicate a famous \u201csouthern tour\u201d by Deng Xiaoping in 1992 that revived economic reforms. Xi and his team have also startled officials by telling them to stop reading empty speeches at meetings.\n\nAnother good sign: I hear that Wang Yang, a reformist who has been the party chief in Guangdong Province and is perhaps the single most capable leader in China today, will be named a vice premier in March.\n\nThe new leaders would probably prefer to accelerate economic change while minimizing political relaxation, but that is increasingly difficult as China develops an educated, worldly and self-confident middle class. Over the years, most of China\u2019s neighbors \u2014 from Taiwan to Mongolia, South Korea to Thailand \u2014 have become more democratic, and now even Myanmar is joining the parade. How can mighty China be more backward than Myanmar?\n\nFor 25 years, I\u2019ve regularly been visiting my wife\u2019s ancestral village in the Taishan area of southern China. At first, the villagers were semiliterate and isolated, but now their world has been transformed. On this visit, we dropped by a farmhouse where a former peasant was using the Internet to trade stocks on his laptop. His daughter is in college, and he watches Hong Kong television on a big screen.\n\nPeople like him are ever harder to control or manipulate, and they\u2019re steamed at China\u2019s worsening corruption. A couple of decades ago, a friend who is a son of a Politburo member was paid several hundred thousand dollars a year to lend his name to a Chinese company so that it could get cheap land from local governments. These days, the family members of leaders can rake in billions of dollars over time.\n\nThe 70 richest delegates to China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress have a collective net worth of almost $90 billion, Bloomberg News reported. That\u2019s more than 10 times the collective net worth of the entire American Congress.\n\nGranted, there is evidence to counter my optimistic take. Most troubling, the authorities are cracking down on the Internet. That\u2019s a great leap backward, but I am skeptical that it will be sustained. Right now a fascinating test case is unfolding: a senior propaganda official censored a New Year\u2019s message in a major Guangdong newspaper, and now journalists are publicly demanding that he be fired. Stay tuned.\n\nXi is also more nationalistic than President Hu, and I worry that a confrontation with Japan over disputed islands could escalate out of control \u2014 in which case all bets are off.\n\nStill, the pre-eminent story of our time is the rise of China. For the last decade it has been hobbled by the failed leadership of President Hu. I\u2019m betting that in the coming 10 years of Xi\u2019s reign, China will come alive again.", "summary": "China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next top leader has the potential to be a game changer, and to nourish China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise with sweeping economic and political reforms.", "compression": 41.44, "coverage": 0.76, "density": 1.08, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

The pairing rivals the Lakers\u2019 Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol in star power and could eventually overtake them. Paul is just 26, while Griffin \u2014 the reigning rookie of the year and slam-dunk champion \u2014 is 22.\n\nThe intrigue comes with asterisks and anger.\n\nThe Clippers completed the blockbuster deal only six nights after Commissioner David Stern \u2014 acting as the Hornets\u2019 de facto owner \u2014 rejected a three-team deal that would have sent Paul to the Lakers. The decision was quickly denounced by team officials around the league, who considered it improper for Stern to dictate where a player would land.\n\nStern, in a conference call Wednesday night, conceded the awkward position created by the league\u2019s ownership of the Hornets. But he defended his veto of the Lakers deal and said the trade sending Paul to the Clippers \u201cis a very good transaction and better for the future of the Hornets\u201d than \u201cthe transaction on which I did not sign off.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers are sending the Hornets four of their best assets: shooting guard Eric Gordon, who turns 23 this month; a 2012 first-round draft pick that belonged to the Minnesota Timberwolves; the promising young forward Al-Farouq Aminu; and center Chris Kaman, whose expiring contract will help the Hornets lower their payroll.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s pick, which is unprotected, might be the most valuable piece in the package. The Timberwolves are almost guaranteed to be in the lottery again, and the 2012 draft is expected to be stocked with elite talent.\n\nThe trade that Stern rejected last week would have sent the Lakers\u2019 Lamar Odom to New Orleans, along with three players from the Houston Rockets \u2014 Luis Scola, Kevin Martin and Goran Dragic \u2014 plus a first-round pick from the Lakers.\n\nThe package the Hornets received from the Clippers is less accomplished, but younger and certainly brimming with talent.\n\nWhen asked why this deal was superior to the one he vetoed, Stern demurred and passed the question to Dell Demps, the Hornets\u2019 general manager, who was also on the call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting some exciting young players,\u201d Demps said, adding, \u201cI think for the long-term future of the New Orleans Hornets, this is the best move.\u201d\n\nBut Demps said that trading Paul \u2014 who had asked to be dealt \u2014 was \u201cbittersweet.\u201d Paul, a four-time All-Star and one of the league\u2019s top point guards, was the face of the franchise for six years, leading the Hornets to the playoffs three times. He averaged 15.8 points and 9.8 assists last season.\n\nPaul and Griffin will be together for at least two seasons, with Paul agreeing as part of the trade to opt into his contract for 2012-13, rather than become a free agent. The Clippers\u2019 hope is that Paul\u2019s arrival convinces Griffin to stay, and vice versa.\n\nThe Lakers and the Clippers will meet next week in two preseason games at Staples Center, the downtown arena they both call home.\n\nThe Paul-Griffin pairing is easily the most talented in the modern history of the Clippers, who have made the playoffs only four times since moving to Los Angeles in 1984. It came at a steep price.\n\nGordon, who averaged 22.3 points last season, is a rising star, and Aminu is highly regarded. The Clippers had resisted parting with both Gordon and the Minnesota draft pick, initially telling the Hornets they had to choose one. At one point, the Hornets were also asking for Eric Bledsoe, a promising young point guard.\n\nIn the end, the Hornets \u2014 with Demps as the point person, but with the commissioner\u2019s office overseeing every move \u2014 got four of the Clippers\u2019 best five trading chips.\n\nThe Clippers now have a big hole at shooting guard and some depth problems. But they have a promising young anchor at center, the 23-year-old DeAndre Jordan, whom the Clippers re-signed earlier this week.\n\nThe Clippers also have an overabundance of point guards with Paul, Bledsoe, Mo Williams and Chauncey Billups, whom they claimed on waivers earlier in the week. One or more of those players could be traded to fill the shooting-guard vacancy.\n\nThe Hornets are essentially starting over, but with a young and inexpensive lineup that the league hopes will be attractive to potential buyers. Stern said he expected the franchise to be sold in the first half of 2012. The league purchased the team from George Shinn last December for $300 million.\n\nThe sale will relieve Stern of his duties as the Hornets\u2019 steward, removing him from the untenable position of serving as both commissioner and team owner. Stern\u2019s veto last week set off a wave of conspiracy theories: that he had caved in to rival owners, who did not want the Lakers to get Paul; or that he was keeping Paul in New Orleans to prop up a small-market team.\n\nStern said he made the decision himself and dismissed the \u201cfrenzy\u201d of angry reactions and \u201cwild speculation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that we were doing the best thing for New Orleans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was my job.

The timing also means that a final decision on how to proceed with the politically sensitive case will be delayed until weeks after President Hu Jintao has returned from his visit this week to the United States.\n\nUntil now, prosecutors and other Chinese officials have refused to clarify the status of the case or even take telephone calls from the defense team. The disclosure of a new investigation period came this afternoon, after one of Mr. Zhao's defense lawyers reached a prosecutor on the telephone for the first time in weeks. The prosecutor said that in late March, days after the withdrawal of the case, the authorities had initiated a new six-week investigation.\n\nAt the end of that period in early May, investigators will decide whether to reinstate the charges. Technically, there is still a chance that Mr. Zhao could be freed. But Mo Shaoping, the lead defense lawyer, said he spoke today to another official briefed on the case who indicated that the prosecution against Mr. Zhao would likely be \"resumed.\"\n\nMr. Zhao, 44, has been jailed for 19 months on charges of fraud and disclosing state secrets to The Times. He has denied the charges, and The Times has said Mr. Zhao did not provide the newspaper with any state secrets. On March 17, a Beijing court granted a prosecution request to withdraw the case. The move prompted speculation that Mr. Zhao might be released, possibly in a goodwill gesture in advance of Mr. Hu's trip.\n\nInstead, Mr. Zhao, who works in the Beijing office of The Times, remained in jail, despite the lack of any charges against him. One question now is whether prosecutors used the withdrawal as a procedural maneuver to delay the case, which had been scheduled for late March. Legal experts say Mr. Zhao should have been released after the withdrawal, regardless of whether prosecutors had intended to reopen the case.\n\n\"This is a man who has been held for a long time after the indictment was withdrawn,\" said John Kamm, a human rights campaigner, whose United States-based Dui Hua Foundations works to free political prisoners in China. \"I think it is a terrible black eye for the Chinese justice system. It's a terrible black eye because there is no transparency, there is no accountability.\"\n\nMr. Zhao's case has brought widespread criticism on China from international human rights groups at a time when China is emphasizing the development of its legal system. The United States, arguing that the case lacked merit, has called on China to release Mr. Zhao. President Bush has twice made a personal appeal on Mr. Zhao's behalf.\n\nMr. Hu is spending four days in the United States this week for an important diplomatic visit that includes a White House meeting with President Bush. In years past, China has often released at least one high-profile political prisoner in advance of a presidential visit.\n\nBut, as yet, China has not released anyone and has refused to discuss Mr. Zhao. The Chinese media is forbidden from reporting on the case. A Foreign Ministry spokesman has said that China would act \"according to law.\"\n\n\"We are not authorized to speak to you,\" Wang Zhiqin, the Beijing prosecutor in charge of the case, said this afternoon. She refused to confirm that the case was going forward.\n\nFor weeks, there have been indications that local prosecutors no longer have decision-making authority over the case. Employees in the prosecutors' office have told Mr. Zhao's family that higher authorities would decide his fate. Mr. Kamm said decisions about the case are likely being made at high levels of the Communist Party, outside the framework of the legal system.\n\nMr. Zhao's arrest is tied to a Sept. 7, 2004, article in The Times that revealed that former President Jiang Zemin had offered to relinquish his last leadership position, as head of the military. The article, which proved accurate when Mr. Jiang later quit, infuriated top leaders, who forbid any media coverage of the inner-workings of the party. A high-level investigation was launched to determine the source of the leak.\n\nMr. Zhao was arrested 10 days after the publication of the article. Once a prominent Chinese journalist, Mr. Zhao had started working for The Times in April 2004. If convicted of disclosing state secrets, he faces at least 10 years in prison.\n\nChinese law dictates that if prosecutors withdraw a case, they must present new evidence in order to file the same charges. When the case was withdrawn last month, Mr. Mo initially equated the decision to a finding of innocence for Mr. Zhao and predicted his immediate release. He has since accused prosecutors of blatantly distorting the law.\n\n\"It is absolutely against the law that they kept him after dropping the case,\" Mr. Mo said in an interview today. \"Even if they had wanted to reopen the case, they should have released him after they withdrew the case.\"", "summary": "An investigation period could lead to reinstating a state-secrets case against a researcher for The New York Times.", "compression": 49.0952380952, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 5.2857142857, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

But Hurricane Sandy had other ideas.\n\nA signed, limited-edition version did come out in November, so I was happily able to include it on The New York Times\u2019s list of the best classical music recordings of 2012. But it was not until Friday evening at the Spectrum, a cozily cluttered loft on the Lower East Side that became a new-music space over the summer, that Ms. Cuckson could publicly celebrate.\n\nOne of the final products of Nono\u2019s ceaselessly experimental career, \u201cLa Lontananza\u201d veers from ethereal near-silence to jagged eruptions. It puts Ms. Cuckson in a series of anxious, eerie confrontations with previously taped material that is manipulated by the composer Christopher Burns, who responds to the violinist in real time by highlighting certain tracks and suppressing others.\n\nThe tapes feature snippets of improvisation by the violinist Gidon Kremer, who gave the work\u2019s premiere in 1988, and a range of noises from the recording studio, including murmurs of conversation and a haunting burst of laughter.\n\nAdding another level of complexity, Nono intended the violinist, who seems to represent a wandering figure in the abstract drama of the piece, to travel to different locations around the performance space for each of the six sections. Mr. Burns produced the album with the composer and sound designer Richard Warp, and using five-channel surround-sound technology they were able to create, for the first time, a recorded analogue of this spatial element. (The two-disc release features one version in surround sound and one in normal stereo.)\n\nThe production is remarkable in another important respect. Nono\u2019s indications of dynamics \u2014 the loudness and softness of the music \u2014 are extreme; his score calls for levels of quiet as intense as \u201cppppppppp,\u201d nine degrees of softness. On recordings, dynamics often disappoint. A degree of compression is part of the process, bringing loud and soft closer together and creating a generally blander experience.\n\nBut as an audience member remarked on Friday, the dynamics on the powerful, strikingly raw new recording may be even more vivid than their live counterparts. Ms. Cuckson and Mr. Burns performed two sections of the work live, then listened along with the audience to two other sections from the recording, and both felt differently essential.\n\nThe live performance benefited from Ms. Cuckson\u2019s vulnerable yet vibrant physical presence, including some faint, melancholy vocalizations as she played, a part of Nono\u2019s score apparently overlooked or ignored by previous interpreters. When the album played, the colors were even brighter: crackling and hyper-real. You have to hope that Ms. Cuckson and Mr. Burns will continue to perform \u201cLa Lontananza,\u201d but in the meantime their thoughtful, thrilling recording does the work full justice.", "summary": "Miranda Cuckson, the violinist, showcased her interpretation of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Lontananza Nostalgica Utopica Futura\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the Spectrum on the Lower East Side.", "compression": 24.5, "coverage": 0.7916666667, "density": 2.375, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

Simple enough, but it suddenly gave a new twist to Ms. Didion\u2019s large body of nonfiction, much of it written in the first person. While I used to take the authenticity of her narrative voice for granted, \u201cThe Year of Magical Thinking\u201d reminded me that her \u201cI\u201d is as artificial, as carefully calibrated a construct, as any figure in a play or novel.\n\nThat realization returned as I watched much of the footage that Lincoln Center will screen in \u201cArt Song on Film,\u201d a four-part series celebrating masterly lieder performances that begins on Saturday at the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center and concludes Wednesday at the Walter Reade Theater. If opera productions are the novels of vocal music \u2014 immersive, imagined worlds \u2014 then song recitals are first-person essays like Ms. Didion\u2019s.\n\nThey appear to dispense with illusion \u2014 no sets or costumes, just a singer and a pianist \u2014 but they are not necessarily more real for it. Seemingly transparent, they are also opaque. They don\u2019t offer a singer unadorned, as many claim, but rather demand the most subtle and difficult kind of performance: the performance of self.\n\nHow would you act if you had to act like you? With her tight smile and shining eyes, the German soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, seen here in excerpts from the 1960s and 1970, can give the impression of a lady of leisure trying anxiously to keep dark thoughts at bay. Filmed in 1988, Arleen Auger, the American soprano, is a more modern woman: a seen-it-all bourgeois mother, perhaps, earnest and wry by turn. The Slovakian soprano Lucia Popp is ever the dewy ing\u00e9nue, even in Strauss\u2019s autumnal \u201cFour Last Songs.\u201d\n\nThe German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, filmed in 1959, when he was just 33, radiates youthful seriousness singing Schubert, his voice a column of steadiness and restraint even at the beginning of his career. Thomas Quasthoff, the German bass-baritone, seen in selections from 2002, when he was 42, seems many more than nine years older than Fischer-Dieskau, with the mellow power of a benevolent patriarch.\n\nA good chunk of these performances are available on YouTube and elsewhere, but I had not been familiar with one of the best selections: the German mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig\u2019s performance of Brahms\u2019s two Opus 91 songs for alto, piano and viola, filmed in 1972 in an airy gallery at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.\n\nWith rhapsodic accompaniment from Leonard Bernstein on piano and the violist Daniel Benjamin, Ms. Ludwig is both serene and vibrantly alive, with a rich bloom to her voice. Singing \u201cDie qual zerrinnt\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe pain subsides\u201d \u2014 in the second song, \u201cGeistliches Wiegenlied,\u201d she bites into the consonants in the verb, recalling the pain even as it eases.\n\nThe program that includes her, Auger and Popp is deeply rewarding, though Georg Solti leads Popp and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at tempos brisk to the point of curtness in \u201cFour Last Songs.\u201d Auger, like Ms. Ludwig, is peaceful but not tranquil, passionate even when calm, as in Strauss\u2019s \u201cFreundliche Vision.\u201d\n\nRadiating lucid warmth, she treats Mahler\u2019s \u201cAbl\u00f6sung im Sommer\u201d with charm rather than cutesiness. In Strauss\u2019s \u201cSchlechtes Wetter,\u201d her voice has the shine of the \u201clonely little light\u201d described in the second stanza, and her voice\u2019s easy agility in fast passages contrasts with the brittleness of Schwarzkopf\u2019s in Strauss\u2019s \u201cMuttert\u00e4ndelei.\u201d\n\nThe Schwarzkopf program, in fact, is the most frustrating in the series, including a gushing 2002 documentary, \u201cElisabeth Schwarzkopf: A Self Portrait,\u201d that is silent about her active membership in the Nazi Party and her decades of lies about it.\n\nRenowned for her lieder performances, she has beautiful moments in sets of songs by Strauss (from 1967) and Wolf (1961), floating the word \u201cber\u00fchren\u201d \u2014 \u201cto touch\u201d \u2014 in Strauss\u2019s \u201cWaldseligkeit.\u201d But a series of details does not make for sustained emotion. Her pitch is often flat, and her affect has a cold, steely core even when the mood is gentle. These performances reinforce my sense that she is one of the most overrated singers of the 20th century.\n\nOddly, it is in the final excerpts, from 1970, that she sounds freshest. Collaborating once again with the distinguished accompanist Gerald Moore, who also joins Fischer-Dieskau, Schwarzkopf is physically transformed from the earlier recitals: her hair looser, the bags under her eyes heavier. Here, in Wolf\u2019s \u201cDas Verlassene M\u00e4gdlein\u201d and \u201cIn dem Schatten Meiner Locken,\u201d she finally manages to convey naturalness and intimacy.\n\nIf there is a melancholy spirit hovering over the series, it is in its reminders of the death of Fischer-Dieskau in 2012 and the retirement of Mr. Quasthoff the same year as a result of health problems. (He was born with serious physical disabilities caused by thalidomide poisoning.)\n\nBoth losses still smart, as does that of the conductor Claudio Abbado, who died last month. He joins Mr. Quasthoff, who drips with sweat, and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in a set of Schubert songs arranged for orchestra. The camera angles afford poignant glimpses of the singer and conductor interacting, with Mr. Abbado carefully overseeing the ensemble\u2019s volume.\n\nThis is beefed-up lieder, not just voice and piano, but Mr. Quasthoff never exaggerates, even in the mighty climax of \u201cDu Bist die Ruh\u201d or the sneering \u201cEure Majest\u00e4t\u201d in \u201cPrometheus.\u201d He movingly underplays the restless loneliness of \u201cDer Wegweiser\u201d and, in the evocation of the \u201cfragrance of dreams\u201d in \u201cGreisengesang,\u201d lightens his voice without cheating or crooning. It\u2019s a remarkable testament to a sorely missed artist.\n\nOpera certainly has a visual thrill that recitals lack, and next year Lincoln Center will turn to screenings of full productions of Weill and Handel, including Peter Sellars\u2019s galvanic staging of Handel\u2019s oratorio \u201cTheodora,\u201d seen at the Glyndebourne Festival in England in 1996, and a 2010 version of that composer\u2019s \u201cAlcina\u201d from the Vienna State Opera.\n\nBut this series of recital footage is important viewing, with our lives \u2014 carefully crafted visions of our lives \u2014 ever more on public display. Simultaneously honest and untrustworthy, both a performance and not, lieder has never been so relevant and valuable.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on February 8, 2014, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Singer\u2019s Artifice, Flickering on Film.

But for listeners across the country, that not-quite-natural disaster also marked the beginning of a party that hasn't ended yet. Ever since those awful days last year, the country has been celebrating the rich musical heritage of New Orleans.\n\nTimothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images\n\nSons of the Crescent City: from left, the rappers B. G., Juvenile and Lil Wayne.\n\nTimothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images\n\nFrom left, Fab 5 Freddy, Crazy Legs, Ice T, Brent Glass of the Smithsonian, Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash.\n\nThere was a blitz of benefit concerts, including \"From the Big Apple to the Big Easy,\" a pair of shows held simultaneously at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall last September. A New Orleans jam session closed the show at the Grammy Awards in February. There have been scads of well-intentioned compilations, including \"Our New Orleans: A Benefit Album for the Gulf Coast\" (Nonesuch), \"Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now\" (Concord) and \"Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert\" (Blue Note), a live album recorded at the Jazz at Lincoln Center Benefit. At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony last month, a video segment paid tribute to New Orleans music through the years, from Louis Armstrong to the Neville Brothers; there was also the inevitable New Orleans jam session.\n\nBut one thing all these tributes have in common is that they all ignored the thrilling \u0097 and wildly popular \u0097 sound of New Orleans hip-hop, the music that has been the city's true soundtrack through the last few decades.\n\nRap music remains by far New Orleans's most popular musical export. Lil Wayne, Master P, Juvenile, Mannie Fresh, B. G., Mystikal and many other pioneers have sold millions of albums, and they have helped make their city an indispensable part of the hip-hop world. Unlike all the other musicians celebrated at post-Katrina tributes, these ones still show up on the pop charts, often near the top. (Juvenile's most recent album made its debut at No. 1, last month.) Yet when tourists and journalists descend upon the city next weekend, for the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, they'll find only one local rapper on the schedule: Juvenile, who is to appear on the Congo Square Louisiana Rebirth Stage at 6 p.m. Saturday.\n\nMaybe New Orleans rappers don't mind being left out. No doubt most of them prefer popularity \u0097 and its rewards \u0097 to respect. But why should they have to choose?\n\nHip-hop was long considered unfit for polite society. And yet the extraordinary snubbing of New Orleans hip-hop comes at a time when the genre is gaining institutional validation. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History recently announced plans for a hip-hop exhibit. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum exhibited \"Roots, Rhyme and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story\" in 1999. Colleges and universities around the country are offering conferences and courses devoted to hip-hop history. At the same time that hip-hop is being written out of the history of New Orleans, it's being written into the history of America. Could that possibly be a coincidence?\n\nThe story of New Orleans hip-hop begins in earnest with what is known as bounce music: festive beats, exuberant chants, simple lyrics that ruled local nightclubs and breezeway parties in the late 1980's and early 90's. The future hip-hop star Juvenile got his start in the bounce-music scene. But like many New Orleans musicians before him, Juvenile found out that having a citywide hit wasn't quite the same as having a nationwide hit.\n\nBy the mid-90's, Southern hip-hop was starting to explode, and so some New Orleans entrepreneurs figured out ways to go national. Master P, a world-class hustler and less-than-world-class rapper from the city's rough Calliope projects, founded a label called No Limit, and used it to popularize a distinctively New Orleans-ish form of hard-boiled hip-hop. For a time Master P was one of pop music's most successful moguls. (He made the cover of Fortune, and he never let anyone forget it.)\n\nMaster P's crosstown rivals were the Williams brothers, proprietors of Cash Money Records, which eventually replaced No Limit as the city's dominant brand name. Cash Money signed up the hometown hero Juvenile (who was raised in the Magnolia projects), as well as the city's greatest hip-hop producer, Mannie Fresh. Working with a great group of rappers including Lil Wayne and B. G., Fresh perfected an exuberant electronic sound; he did as much as anyone to pull the musical legacy of New Orleans into the 21st century. You could hear brass bands in the synthesizers, drum lines in the rattling beats, Mardi Gras Indians in the sing-song lyrics. (If you're wondering where to start, try Juvenile's head-spinning 1998 blockbuster, \"400 Degreez,\" which has sold 4.7 million copies.)\n\nLike most musical stories, this one doesn't really have a happy ending \u0097 or any ending at all. Master P's empire dissolved, which explains why you might recently have seen him on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Mystikal, one of the city's best and weirdest rappers, split with No Limit in 2000, and he's currently serving a jail sentence for sexual battery and tax evasion. Juvenile, B. G. and Mannie Fresh have all left Cash Money, though Lil Wayne remains.", "summary": "New Orleans's music is endlessly celebrated.

The essay runs through the evidence suggesting that women tend to have too little self-confidence. When asked how well they did on tests, women tend to estimate that they got fewer answers correct than they actually did. In one British study, a business school professor asked students how much they would deserve to earn five years after graduation. The women\u2019s estimates were 20 percent lower than the men\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to read the evidence as a guy, especially if you\u2019re a self-aggrandizing pundit who covers politics and public life. I almost never see problems caused by underconfidence, but I see (and create) problems related to overconfidence every day.\n\nMuch of the recent psychological research also suggests that overconfidence is our main cognitive problem, not the reverse. Daniel Kahneman\u2019s book \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d describes an exhaustive collection of experiments demonstrating how often people come to conclusions confidently and wrongly. When asked to estimate if more murders happen in Detroit or in Michigan, most people give higher estimates for Detroit even though every murder in Detroit also happens in Michigan.\n\nDan Ariely\u2019s work shows how consistently we overpraise our virtues and rationalize our faults so we can think too highly of ourselves. Most of us call ourselves honest. But, in fact, most people regularly cheat in small ways, when the situation is right.\n\nSo my first reaction when reading of female underconfidence is not simply that this is a problem. It\u2019s to ask, how can we inject more of this self-doubt and self-policing into the wider culture. How can each of us get a better mixture of \u201cfemale\u201d self-doubt and \u201cmale\u201d self-assertion?\n\nBut my second reaction is to notice that people are phenomenally terrible at estimating their own self-worth. Some Americans seem to value themselves ridiculously too little while others value themselves ridiculously too highly.\n\nThe self-help books try to boost the \u201cconfidence\u201d part of self-confidence, but the real problem is the \u201cself\u201d part. The self, as writers have noticed for centuries, is an unstable, fickle, vain and variable thing. Hundreds of years ago, David Hume noticed that when he tried to enter into what he called his most intimate self, he always stumbled on some particular perception or another. He never could catch himself without a perception of something else, and he never could see himself, only the perception.\n\nWhen you try to come up with a feeling for self-confidence, you are trying to peer into a myriad of ever-changing mental systems, most of them below the level of awareness. Instead of coming up with a real thing, which can reliably be called self-confidence, you\u2019re just conjuring an abstraction. In the very act of trying to think about self-confidence, your vanity is creating this ego that is unstable and ethereal, and is thus painfully fragile, defensive, boasting and sensitive to sleights.\n\nIf you want to talk about something real, it\u2019s probably a mistake to use a suspect concept like self-confidence, which is self-oriented. It\u2019s probably a better idea to think about competence, which is task-oriented. If you ask, \u201cAm I competent?\u201d at least you are measuring yourself according to the standards of a specific domain.\n\nThe person with the self-confidence mind-set starts thinking about his own intrinsic state. The person who sees herself as the instrument for performing a task thinks about some external thing that needs doing. The person with the confidence mind-set is like the painfully self-conscious person at a dinner party who asks, \u201cHow am I coming across?\u201d The person with an instrumentalist mind-set is serving a craft and asks \u201cWhat does this specific job require?\u201d The person with a confidence mind-set is told \u201cBelieve in yourself.\u201d This arouses all sorts of historical prejudices and social stereotypes. The person with an instrumentalist mind-set is told \u201cLook accurately at what you have done.\u201d\n\nOne of the hard things in life is learning to ask questions that you can actually answer. For example, if you are thinking about taking a job, it\u2019s probably foolish to ask, \u201cWhat future opportunities will this lead to?\u201d You can\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably better to ask, \u201cWill going to this workplace be rewarding day to day?\u201d which is more concrete. If you are getting married, it\u2019s probably foolish to ask an unknowable question like, \u201cWill this person make me happy for 50 years?\u201d It\u2019s probably smarter to ask, \u201cIs this person admirable enough that I want to live my life as an offering to them?\u201d You can at least glimpse another\u2019s habits here and now.\n\nSimilarly, if you start thinking about your self-confidence, you will just be inventing a self-referential story. It\u2019s probably easier to go through life focusing on what specifically needs doing, rooted in a set of external obligations and criteria and thus quieting the self.\n\nA version of this op-ed appears in print on May 13, 2014, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: The Problem With Confidence .

Lawyers said the conviction gave new potential to hate-crime prosecutions for cyberbullying and digital spying largely because it seemed to repudiate the notion that youth was a defense.\n\n\u201cThe debate in this case was, Was this a stupid college prank or criminal intimidation?

McRae, a former federal prosecutor, said. \u201cJurors will say their kid or kids they know are more sophisticated than that,\u201d Mr. McRae said. \u201cFor jurors, it doesn\u2019t pass the common-sense test.\u201d\n\nMr. Ravi had seemed so confident that his defense would work that he turned down a plea offer that would have required community service. He now faces a possible prison term and could be deported to India, where he was born.\n\nLawyers said the trial in New Brunswick had drawn such intense attention that it would shape future cases because youthful indiscretion had always been an appealing defense. \u201cIt had a shot of having enough jurors say, \u2018This is a jerky kid, and, look, they\u2019ve thrown the book at him,\u2019 \u201d said Marc R. Poirier, a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark. \u201cIt was a roll of the dice, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe facts of the case, which began in a Rutgers University dorm room in 2010, were never in much dispute. It was just the interpretation that each side saw differently.\n\nMr. Ravi spied by computer on his roommate, Tyler Clementi, and gossiped about him on Twitter, the jury heard. Mr. Clementi, an awkward violinist, had been \u201cmaking out with a dude,\u201d Mr. Ravi wrote on Twitter. Later, Mr. Ravi, an ultimate Frisbee player who seemed to thrive on attention, invited people to watch when Mr. Clementi again had a male visitor.\n\nThe prosecutor, Julia McClure, saw Mr. Ravi\u2019s actions as far more than mischievous. She said they were \u201cmean-spirited, they were malicious, they were criminal.\u201d\n\nBut Steven Altman, Mr. Ravi\u2019s lawyer, called him \u201can 18-year-old boy, a kid,\u201d a college freshman who was not biased against his gay roommate but \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to deal with it.\u201d\n\nMs. Goldberg, the Columbia law professor, said the prosecution had posed an important challenge to the sense in many schools and colleges that youthfulness provided a kind of immunity for activities and speech in the online world. She said many students seemed to believe the ideas put forth by Mr. Ravi\u2019s defense, that being a kid meant there were few limits to how offensive they might be when using digital devices.\n\n\u201cThis reinforces that social media can cause great harm and that its misuse can be criminal,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. She said she expected that the lessons of the courtroom conviction would probably be studied broadly, including in discussions at college orientations across the country.\n\nDefense lawyers said that once Mr. Ravi had decided to take his chances at a trial rather than pleading guilty, there were few options for the defense. The 15-count indictment and Mr. Ravi\u2019s own videotaped acknowledgment of many of the facts gave the prosecutors a powerful arsenal.\n\nThe charges took note of the damaging fact that Mr. Ravi had tried to change electronic messages he had sent and seemed to encourage a witness to change her account.\n\nA live witness in the courtroom, Mr. Clementi\u2019s sexual partner, a 30-year-old man identified only as M. B., described the eerie feeling of being watched by the camera on Mr. Ravi\u2019s computer.\n\nAnd though Mr. Ravi was not charged with the death, there was the ever-present fact of Mr. Clementi\u2019s suicide. The jury heard that a day before Mr. Clementi killed himself, Mr. Ravi sent a message to a friend: \u201cKeep the gays away.\u201d\n\nFaced with that kind of case, it was logical to argue that there was a thin line between a bias crime and an immature college prank, Joseph Tacopina, a New York defense lawyer, said. \u201cWhat other defense could it have been?\u201d he said.\n\nBut after Friday\u2019s conviction, some lawyers said, the risks of rejecting a plea bargain and arguing the jerky-kid defense were obvious. In a similar case in the future, said Ronald L. Kuby, a New York defense lawyer, he would remember what happened to Mr. Ravi.\n\nHis advice to a client, he said, would be: \u201c \u2018Remember what happened to Ravi.

The lyrics detail her birth in the Jim Crow South, her childhood in \u201cthe Bronx Is Burning\u201d New York, the years she spent rejected by record companies for being \u201ctoo short, too fat, too black and too old,\u201d and, most recently, her well-publicized battles with cancer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d live to see another day,\u201d the 60-year-old singer declares in the final verse. \u201cBut I\u2019m still here!\u201d\n\nIn fact, she is more present than ever. In the last nine months, Ms. Jones and her well-regarded band, the Dap-Kings, have recorded two albums, opened two national tours for Hall & Oates, and been featured, along with Matthew McConaughey, in a TV car commercial for Lincoln, performing the Allman Brothers\u2019 \u201cMidnight Rider.\u201d For a capper, a documentary about her life, \u201cMiss Sharon Jones!,\u201d opened on Friday, after making the festival circuit.\n\nDirected by Barbara Kopple, the film chronicles aspects of the singer\u2019s career, including her extremely rare breakthrough to stardom in her late 40s, which made her an underdog hero. With her high-power vocals growling over the Dap-Kings\u2019 caffeinated soul, Ms. Jones channels the power of James Brown in his prime. Mainly, though, the film traces her life from a terrifying diagnosis of Stage 2 pancreatic cancer in 2013 through her triumphant return to the stage in 2015.\n\nThe celebratory tone we hear from Ms. Jones at the end of the movie contrasts with the more muted one she sometimes strikes today. Though she was energized during a face-to-face interview, a phone conversation last week found her more enervated, reflecting a hard new turn in her story.\n\nWhile on tour in May, doctors found cancer cells in her stomach, lymph nodes and lungs, necessitating a fresh round of chemotherapy. On Monday in New York, Ms. Jones endured more, but in a new calibration she had requested. \u201cOne of the chemo (drugs) that they\u2019re giving me makes the neuropathy in my feet move up my legs,\u201d Ms. Jones said several hours after her session. \u201cI can\u2019t take that anymore. I need to dance onstage. I don\u2019t want something that makes me bedridden. I want to live my life to the fullest.\u201d\n\nHer determination gives the documentary its lift. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a maudlin film,\u201d Ms. Kopple said. \u201cSharon is always up. Even when she\u2019s in the room where people are getting chemo, she\u2019s the sunshine.\u201d\n\nOriginally, the documentary wasn\u2019t going to concentrate on Ms. Jones\u2019s illness, according to her manager, Alex Kadvan, who initiated the film. \u201cI wanted to tell her whole musical story,\u201d he said. \u201cBut other things happened.\u201d\n\nThe first day of shooting, on Labor Day weekend 2013, caught a rough moment: Ms. Jones was holding her shorn braids in her hands after having her head shaved. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the film three times, and every time I see that scene I cry,\u201d she said.\n\nThe early part of the film casts back to Ms. Jones\u2019s childhood, which was rife with racial indignities. During her birth in Augusta, Ga., her mother needed a cesarean operation, but since the hospital didn\u2019t allow African-Americans in their main units, the procedure took place in an unsanitary storage room. In the film, Ms. Jones returns to a local store she patronized as a child, where she said the owner had trained his parrot to recite a racial epithet whenever a black person entered. \u201cIt had a lot of effect on us as children,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cYou\u2019d be afraid when you saw white people.\u201d\n\nA preview of the film.\n\nAfter her parents divorced in the mid-60s, \u201cI came to New York and got sassy,\u201d Ms. Jones said with a laugh. Over the years, she sang in church and in wedding bands, while holding day jobs as a prison guard at Rikers Island and in security for Wells Fargo. \u201cShe\u2019s got a tough attitude,\u201d Ms. Kopple said. \u201cI think she drew on that later.\u201d\n\nWhile major labels repeatedly shunned the singer as over the hill and \u201ctoo dark,\u201d she finally found a perfect partner, and a breakthrough, via the fledgling indie Daptone Records, which specializes in reanimating the vintage sounds of soul, funk and Latin music. In the aughts, she helped to construct the label\u2019s studio in Bushwick. The prolific Dap-Kings have put out seven albums with Ms. Jones and backed Amy Winehouse on her album \u201cBack to Black,\u201d while Ms. Jones herself has been a popular choice for cameos on recordings and live shows for artists like Michael Bubl\u00e9, Rufus Wainwright, David Byrne and Phish.\n\nCentral parts of the film show the financial hardships both Ms. Jones and her band underwent when they weren\u2019t able to work during her illness. The film balances that with scenes of the star being nursed back to health in upstate New York by an acquaintance, Megan Holken, whom Ms. Jones had only connected with a few times over the years. Ms. Jones\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and Ms. Holken were friends when the women first met. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like the way he ended it with me,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cI must have made a real impression on her back then. She would cook and spend the whole day with me, and never did she complain.\u201d\n\nOne of the most uplifting scenes finds Ms. Jones going to church to sing for the first time after enduring months of chemotherapy. Walking up the stairs, she\u2019s exhausted. But the minute she starts singing \u201cHis Eye Is on the Sparrow,\u201d she taps a herculean strength. \u201cThe spirit came over me,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference for the film\u2019s first showing at the Toronto Film Festival last September, Ms. Jones dampened things by announcing news of her cancer\u2019s initial return. At that time, doctors found a spot on her liver (later treated with radiation). \u201cI didn\u2019t want people to come up and congratulate me on beating cancer when it\u2019s back,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, the singer lets her audience at shows this year know some of what she\u2019s going through with the cancer\u2019s latest re-emergence. \u201cThere\u2019s pain in my hips, and my legs feel like tons,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting out on that stage, that\u2019s my therapy. You have to look at life the way it is. No one knows how long I have. But I have the strength now and I want to continue.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2016, on page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: A Burst of Light, Even in Dark Times.

S. Eliot, created a cultural brouhaha over the appropriateness of fictionalizing the lives of real people, died on Nov. 19, at his home in London. He was 73.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said Andrew Hewson, his agent.\n\nLike his British contemporary Shelagh Delaney, the author of \u201cA Taste of Honey\u201d who also died this month, Mr. Hastings was a precocious success. His first play, \u201cDon\u2019t Destroy Me,\u201d written while he was serving an apprenticeship as a tailor, was about the emotional paralysis of a tailor\u2019s apprentice in a working-class Jewish family, and was produced to critical praise in London in 1956, when he was just 18.\n\nThe next year, a second play, \u201cYes, and After,\u201d about a teenage girl who has been raped, was presented at the prestigious Royal Court Theater, and once again like Ms. Delaney, Mr. Hastings was lumped, perhaps unfairly, with John Osborne, Kingsley Amis, John Wain and other representatives of a literary movement of societal critics who became known as \u201cthe angry young men.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Hastings\u2019s case, the label was premature. Over the next half century, he proved to have a roving literary mind, and he had the career of a genuine man of letters, with a body of work characterized by both seriousness and audacity.\n\nHe traveled widely, living for spells in Spain, East Africa and Brazil, and in addition to his plays, he wrote poetry, novels and biographical studies of Rupert Brooke and Richard Burton; he was also a translator and an opera librettist. He adapted the Henry James novel \u201cThe American\u201d for a 1998 television movie and wrote the screenplay for \u201cThe Nightcomers,\u201d a 1972 film starring Marlon Brando, creating an original story that borrows James\u2019s characters from the novella \u201cThe Turn of the Screw.\u201d\n\nHis 1966 play, \u201cLee Harvey Oswald: A Far Mean Streak of Indepence Brought on by Negleck\u201d (also known as \u201cThe Silence of Lee Harvey Oswald\u201d) was inspired by the Warren Commission report, and sought to marshal the facts of Oswald\u2019s life into a cogent character portrait. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic were divided on whether it succeeded, but the debate over it pre-figured the controversy brought on by his most famous work, which was first produced in London in 1984 and came to New York the following year.\n\n\u201cTom and Viv,\u201d which was made into a 1994 film starring Willem Dafoe and Miranda Richardson, told the story of Eliot\u2019s calamitous 17-year marriage to a high-spirited but unstable British woman, Vivien Haigh-Wood, and its aftermath, when she was committed to a mental hospital where she eventually died. Meticulously researched and treading carefully on delicate personal matters, the play nonetheless engendered outrage, especially in England, from those who found it an unseemly invasion of private lives. On the other hand it also elicited frustration from those, like the New York Times critic Frank Rich, who found it not invasive enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Mr. Hastings has placed too much stock in his store of dry facts,\u201d Mr. Rich wrote. \u201cEloquently written as this work can be, it\u2019s also bloodless until its waning moments. It\u2019s as if the playwright were afraid to take the final plunge of imagining, however speculatively or voyeuristically, just what intimacies his couple might have exchanged in all those rooms they unhappily cohabited.\u201d\n\nThomas Hastings was born in London in September 1938. He was brought up largely by his mother, even before his father, a Royal Air Force flyer, was killed during World War II. Largely an autodidact, he never went to a university, instead became a tailor\u2019s apprentice after he finished school, turning eventually to the theater when he was accepted as a writing and acting trainee at the Royal Court.\n\nMr. Hastings\u2019s other plays include \u201cFor the West (Uganda)\u201d (1977), about the relationship between British imperialism and the lawless rule of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin; \u201cGloo Joo\u201d (1978), a comic farce about racial prejudice, and \u201cCalico\u201d (2004), which, set in 1928, concerns a love affair between Samuel Beckett and Lucia Joyce, James Joyce\u2019s daughter.\n\nHis survivors include his wife, Victoria Hardie, a librettist and playwright; and three children.", "summary": "Mr. Hastings\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best-known work, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTom and Viv,\u00e2\u0080\u009d about the first marriage of T.

I had just asked him if he worried about entering his son into the Greenwich, Conn., public-school system. Greenwich, of course, is one of the wealthiest towns in America, home to hedge-fund billionaires like Steven A. Cohen, who has a world-renowned art collection and a private ice rink. Bonilla is a handyman whose family struggles to make the rent. Wasn\u2019t he just a little concerned that his child would feel self-conscious?\n\n1. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to help low-income students?\n\n2. It might be putting them in a school with rich kids.\n\n3. Who knew Greenwich was a model of equality?\n\nAdam Davidson translates often confusing and sometimes terrifying economic and financial news.\n\nNo, Bonilla told me. In Greenwich schools, he said, \u201cthey teach ice-skating.\u201d His wife, Veronica Llerena, who works as a housekeeper and a cashier at a Peruvian restaurant, added, \u201cThey have everything \u2014 music, sports, art, drama.\u201d She and Bonilla, who farmed a small plot in El Ejido in Andalusia, recently left because \u201cin Spain, he has no future,\u201d Bonilla said, pointing at their 4-year-old son, Manuel Jr., who was sleeping in his mother\u2019s arms. In Greenwich, they thought he did.\n\nThe Bonillas were sitting with other low-income families in the immaculate Greenwich Head Start building. I had long known that Greenwich \u2014 with its grand estates \u2014 was ground zero for the 1 percent, but I was surprised to learn that nearly 4 percent of its residents live below the poverty line. \u201cIt takes a lot of labor to run those estates,\u201d says Bob Arnold, president of Family Centers, a nonprofit social-service agency there. \u201cThey need housekeepers, cooks, landscapers.\u201d I figured that many of those lower-income workers commuted from nearby places like White Plains, N.Y., or Stamford, Conn., where the rents are much cheaper. And many certainly do, but Arnold told me that the families who opt to live just on the Greenwich side of the New York border or in the apartments above the stores on Greenwich Avenue, fit a very specific profile: they pay the costs to have access to the schools that Greenwich\u2019s high property-tax base affords.\n\nWhat Greenwich doesn\u2019t have is an abundance of affordable housing. Megan Sweeney, a director at Family Centers, explained that information about them is often guarded by family members or close friends. The Bonillas moved to Greenwich only because Veronica\u2019s sister, Mercy Llerena, a manager of a private estate, went there from White Plains after marrying a man in town. Another woman I met, Estella Rozende, an immigrant from Brazil, learned about Greenwich from a family friend who has helped dozens get started there.\n\nThe Bonillas and Rozende felt lucky to have children in Greenwich. But historically speaking, researchers haven\u2019t been so sure that it is beneficial to enroll low-income children in wealthier schools. A lot of sociological data, dating to the definitive Coleman Report of 1966, which studied the outcomes of 570,000 students, show that a child\u2019s success in school, more than anything, was determined by her parents\u2019 wealth and education level. So in the decades after the report was issued, attention was lavished on various reforms and integrating schools according to race, not economics.\n\nNew research, however, suggests that economic integration may be the answer. Recently, Heather Schwartz, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, began studying the public-school system of Montgomery County, Md. The county, a suburb of Washington, has one of the most affluent populations in America and an innovative housing authority that allows low-income citizens to rent homes alongside wealthier neighbors at steeply discounted prices. The renters are randomly assigned to different parts of the county; some Montgomery County schools have many poor students, others have almost none. In 2009, Schwartz concluded that students from poor families did much better in predominantly wealthy schools than in predominantly poor ones. On average, the poorer children in wealthier schools cut their achievement gap in half compared with their peers in poorer schools.\n\nAdam Davidson is co-founder of NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlanet Money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a podcast and blog.", "summary": "The Connecticut town may be ground zero for the 1 percent, but its schools have been witness to a low-income economic phenomenon.", "compression": 32.2307692308, "coverage": 0.8846153846, "density": 3.4230769231, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

A few minutes later, Thompson sat at his locker and tried to decompress.\n\nThompson sounded like a teakettle, and the water was still boiling. In his case, it was the slow release of adrenaline \u2014 the electric residue from what he described as the greatest game of his life, a season-saving victory against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night.\n\nThe Warriors, having twice avoided elimination in the series, will host the Thunder on Monday for Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers, who are waiting to learn the identity of their opponent in the N.B.A. finals, must be enjoying their view from a safe distance: two worthy candidates, smashing each other to smithereens.\n\nThompson, a 6-foot-7 shooting guard with a swan-like release, was brilliant in Game 6. He set an N.B.A. playoff record by sinking 11-pointers, and the Warriors, after trailing for much of the game and by as many as 8 points in the fourth quarter, needed all of them in a 108-101 victory.\n\nHis competitive embers still smoldering after the game, Thompson revealed that he had a couple of regrets. By his estimation, he should have finished with 13 3-pointers. Only the most demanding technician could come up with such an exact figure. But it was a window into his psyche. The Warriors are a team of perfectionists.\n\n\u201cI missed some wide-open looks early,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThe Warriors won the game and extended the series by shooting 21 of 44 from 3-point range. The Thunder, on the other hand, shot 3 of 23 from the 3-point line. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook combined to shoot 20 of 58 from the field, ensuring that a familiar phrase \u2014 hero ball \u2014 would trail the Thunder like a toxic stench on their trip back to Oracle Arena.\n\nHere were two teams that took different paths through the final minutes of Game 6. The Warriors produced quality shots with screens, cuts and passes. They looked for the open man. They trusted one another to make the right decisions. In basketball, a pass is the greatest form of trust.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing,\u201d Stephen Curry said, \u201cis just moving the ball and moving bodies, setting screens for each other, trying to create confusion and miscommunication on their end.\u201d\n\nBefore the fourth quarter even started, Curry told Thompson that he would continue to look for him. Curry, the league\u2019s two-time reigning most valuable player, tends to produce his finest basketball in late-game situations. But he could sense that Thompson was rolling.\n\n\u201cThis is your time,\u201d Thompson recalled Curry telling him. \u201cPut on a show out there and have fun.\u201d\n\nCurry had his moments, too. He made consecutive 3-pointers to tie the game. Later, Thompson hit his fifth 3-pointer of the quarter to give the Warriors the lead for good. Curry cluttered the box score with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists. Curry and Thompson have been teammates for five seasons, and it shows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of just telepathic, playing with each other for so long,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cYou just kind of feel it when someone\u2019s on their shot or being aggressive.\u201d\n\nAs Billy Donovan, the coach of the Thunder, observed, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Steph was just going one-on-one.\u201d\n\nIf the Thunder were discombobulated on defense \u2014 and they were, no doubt \u2014 they were even more unkempt on offense. After showcasing so much teamwork throughout the playoffs, the Thunder relapsed and settled for isolation sets. Durant and Westbrook searched for seams by dribbling in jagged lines. Westbrook had an especially difficult time. He committed three turnovers in the final 55 seconds. So much dribbling. So many mistakes. So many questions ahead of Game 7.\n\nAt his postgame news conference, Donovan used the word \u201cstagnant\u201d no fewer than three times. Once upon a time, his team led this series by three games to one.\n\n\u201cYou go 13 percent from the 3-point line and they go 47, that\u2019s a huge discrepancy,\u201d Donovan said, adding, \u201cI thought we made some really positive strides over the last month and a half or since the playoffs started, but I thought we got a little stagnant offensively, no question.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors played a different game. Of their eight 3-pointers in the fourth quarter, six came off assists. One that did not? Thompson measuring up Westbrook from 28 feet, and then launching a twisting heave that fell through to cut into the Thunder\u2019s lead. It was not his most high-percentage shot.\n\n\u201cThat was the only one all night that I thought, What are you doing?\u201d Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of Steph and Klay. They kind of walk that fine line between lethal and crazy, and we have to live with some crazy shots and some crazy misses because they make more than their fair share.\u201d\n\nThompson argued that his feet were set and that he had a strong base beneath him. In other words, he felt confident.\n\nThompson went on to explain that he thinks of the game as a process, describing himself as a \u201ccontinuous player.\u201d Rather than dwell on individual possessions \u2014 the makes, the misses \u2014 he searches for his place within the game\u2019s broader rhythms. So he works with his teammates, feeding off them, trusting them.\n\nFor one game, at least, it was enough to outlast an opponent that looked more like a collection of disassembled parts.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 30, 2016, on page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Warriors Put Trust in 3-Pointers, and One Another.

Mr. Zimmerman, then 28 and a neighborhood watch volunteer, said that Mr. Martin attacked him and that, fearing for his life, he shot the teenager. There were no witnesses to the shooting, which took place in darkness, shortly after 7 p.m. on Feb. 26, 2012. A six-week delay in charging Mr. Zimmerman stirred outrage, and civil rights leaders led marches in Sanford, Miami and elsewhere around the country.\n\nAs he spoke to the jury on Friday, Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara held up the defense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most compelling evidence in the case: photographs of Mr. Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s injured head and nose. And Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara walked the jury through an array of testimony and physical evidence suggesting Mr. Martin was on top during the struggle, which is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account to the police.\n\nBut above all, Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara emphasized to jurors that a claim of self-defense does not require any injuries, only a reasonable fear of great bodily harm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo injuries are necessary to respond with deadly force,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a cut on a finger. The statute is clear. It requires a reasonable fear of bodily harm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe injuries, he said, were \u00e2\u0080\u009cicing on the cake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSoon after, on the floor in front of the jury, Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara placed a slab of concrete, similar to the pavement on which Mr. Martin repeatedly struck Mr. Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is not an unarmed teenager with nothing but Skittles trying to get home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of Mr. Martin. Then he added, referring to the slab of concrete, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe suggestion by the state that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a weapon, that that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt somebody, that that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause great bodily harm, is disgusting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was not Mr. Zimmerman who was the aggressor, he said. It was Mr. Martin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look at those pictures and say that what was visited upon George Zimmerman was not evidence of ill will, spite and hatred,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara said, using legal terms that apply to the second-degree murder charge. Had Mr. Martin survived and been shot through the hip, Mr. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Mara said, \u00e2\u0080\u009che would have been charged with aggravated battery, two counts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut during the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rebuttal argument, a prosecutor, John Guy, asked jurors to use their common sense.\n\nIn his heart, he said, Mr. Zimmerman harbored hatred and ill will toward Mr. Martin. To Mr. Zimmerman, Mr. Martin was not a teenager with Skittles in his pocket, chatting with his friend on the telephone, his hooded shirt shielding him from the rain. He was just another criminal casing the neighborhood, Mr. Guy said.\n\nMr. Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices, he said, spoke volumes about his mind-set: He got out of his car with a gun on his hip; he disregarded a police dispatcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice not to follow Mr. Martin. And then he chased the teenager as he headed home, setting off the fight that led to Mr. Martin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.", "summary": "In closing arguments, the defense emphasized George Zimmerman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fears for his own life and the deadly potential in a slab of concrete.", "compression": 33.5833333333, "coverage": 0.875, "density": 1.625, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

The universities are now the focus of an inquiry by the organization, which says such questions unfairly penalize minorities, who tend to face arrest more frequently and, as a result, could face higher admissions hurdles.\n\n\u201cThe disparities and underrepresentation we see at schools is a concern, and this may indeed be one of the contributing factors,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, the group\u2019s executive director, citing statistics showing low black enrollment at some of the colleges. At Auburn, for example, African-Americans make up 7 percent of the student body in a state where blacks total about 25 percent of the population.\n\nThe organization announced Thursday that it would inquire about practices at Auburn and the 16 other institutions that question prospective students about arrests or other contact with the criminal justice system that stops short of a conviction.\n\nThe inquiry comes amid growing concern that admissions questions about criminal history and disciplinary action discriminate against black applicants, as a body of statistical evidence emerges showing that black teenagers are singled out for disciplinary action in school and stopped by police at unusually high rates.\n\nThe Common Application, used by 600 colleges, does not ask about arrests, but does require applicants to check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to whether they have been convicted of a crime or faced serious disciplinary action in school.\n\nOn Wednesday, New York University\u2019s vice president for enrollment management, MJ Knoll-Finn, wrote a letter to both the chairman and the chief executive of the Common Application asking for an expedited review of whether those questions on its form are fair or necessary. N.Y.U. uses the Common Application.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the context of high rates of school discipline and incarceration among people of color, it seems vital to pose two questions about the checkboxes: do they, in fact, have any predictive value, and does their presence work against universities\u2019 mission as engines of social mobility and diversity either by discouraging applicants or by resulting in unjustified denials of admissions on the grounds of safety or integrity?\u201d Ms. Knoll-Finn\u2019s letter said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Common Application, Aba Blankson, said the group had received N.Y.U.\u2019s letter and was in discussions about the topic, but she declined to discuss details.\n\nA study in 2010 by the Center for Community Alternatives, a nonprofit group in New York, found that 66 percent of colleges ask for criminal history information in admissions, and that some of them look unfavorably even on misdemeanor arrests. At the time, the organization said, the use of such questions appeared to be on the rise after several high-profile criminal cases on university campuses.\n\nMichael Reilly, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said that many schools did not like to ask the questions but had been spurred to do so by campus violence. \u201cAnd they feel they need to do what they can to screen students,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lawyers\u2019 Committee said it planned to contact the 17 institutions on its list as the first wave of a national initiative aimed at reducing the impact of even minor criminal histories on college admissions. Ms. Clarke said her organization planned to ask the colleges why their application forms included such questions. While the current focus is on universities in seven Southern states, the organization said such questions may be asked by colleges nationwide. The 17 colleges on the group\u2019s list include several historically black universities and colleges.\n\nCharles Martin, an Auburn spokesman, said indicating \u201cyes\u201d to the crime question on the application did not disqualify students. \u201cThe admissions office calls the applicant directly to obtain more information,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ms. Clarke said that in some cases, students might be intimidated and elect not to apply rather than answer the question.\n\nThe University of Alabama, where blacks make up 12 percent of the student body, asks prospective students if they are \u201csubject to arrest\u201d and also poses this question: \u201cHave you ever received a written or oral warning not to trespass on public or private property?\u201d A university spokesman, Chris Bryant, said the college had included disciplinary-related questions on its application since 2010, to try to determine whether an applicant\u2019s past behavior posed a safety risk. Answering yes to the questions was not an absolute bar to admission, he said, adding that the university was committed to ensuring that its policies were not discriminatory.\n\nThe civil-rights group identified Virginia Tech, whose enrollment is 4 percent black, as one of the colleges it would look at. The university\u2019s application asks, \u201cHave you ever been arrested or convicted of a violation of any local, state or federal law, other than a minor traffic violation?\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Virginia Tech said the university added questions to its application after April 16, 2007, when a student there shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others before committing suicide. The student had previously been accused of stalking. \u201cThese questions are part of a holistic approach in selecting qualified applicants for undergraduate admission,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Tracy Vosburgh. \u201cWe do not believe this is racially discriminatory.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, three New York colleges dropped arrest language from their admissions applications after a request from the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. \u201cAn arrest or police stop that did not result in a conviction, or a criminal record that was sealed or expunged, should not \u2014 indeed, must not \u2014 be a standard question on a college application,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said at the time.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on January 29, 2016, on page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Colleges Face a Backlash Over Queries About Arrests.

The government\u2019s forces blasted opposition strongholds with tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships. In a government-controlled neighborhood in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, rebels set off a bomb that state news media said killed 17 people and wounded more than 40.\n\nDays after the French government said that it would provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance directly to the rebels controlling five Syrian cities, a spokesman for the Syrian government accused France of undermining the first trip to the region by the new United Nations envoy charged with negotiating a peace, Lakhdar Brahimi.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it supports Brahimi\u2019s mission, while at the same time it makes statements demonstrating that it supports the militarization of the crisis in Syria,\u201d the spokesman, Jihad Makdissi, said of the French government in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe only way to make Brahimi\u2019s mission a success is the cooperation of all parties.\u201d\n\nThe Assad government expressed similar support for peace proposals made by the previous envoy, Kofi Annan, but failed to curb its military campaign to wipe out the opposition. Mr. Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, quit in frustration. And the Assad government has since ruled out any talks with the rebels, dismissing them as foreign agents.\n\nIn Paris, a French doctor who just returned from a two-week medical mission at a rebel-controlled hospital in Aleppo said he was surprised by the number of militants from outside Syria who had joined the fight with the goal of establishing an Islamist government.\n\nThe doctor, Jacques B\u00e9r\u00e8s, 71, a surgeon who is known for missions to war zones and who helped found the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, said in an interview with Reuters that he had treated about 40 patients a day and that 60 percent were rebel fighters, half of whom were from outside Syria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really something strange to see,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. \u201cThey are directly saying that they aren\u2019t interested in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s fall, but are thinking about how to take power afterward and set up an Islamic state with Shariah law to become part of the world emirate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them were French and were completely fanatical about the future,\u201d he added, according to Reuters.\n\nDr. B\u00e9r\u00e8s called the high proportion of foreign Islamist fighters in Aleppo a sharp contrast to his impressions on trips this spring to makeshift clinics in the cities of Idlib and Homs.\n\nActivists and rebel fighters who have been interviewed over the Internet consistently describe far lower numbers of foreign fighters and Islamist militants, and the few reported interviews with Islamists have provided little agreement on what kind of government they envision\u2014 whether along the lines of Turkey, Saudi Arabia or Iran, for example.\n\nAbdulla, an 18-year-old smuggler working along the border with Lebanon, said that he had helped several foreigners \u2014 including two Saudis, two Americans and a German \u2014 cross into Syria to join a cousin\u2019s brigade in Homs and that they all saw the civil war in religious terms. \u201cThey were all seeking jihad,\u201d he said, and for one American, \u201cthe only words he knew in Arabic were \u2018jihad\u2019 and \u2018greetings.\u2019 \u201d (Abdulla, whose full name was withheld for his safety, said he was one of about 15 smugglers working the border.)\n\nDr. B\u00e9r\u00e8s said that the bombing raids by the Syrian government appeared to be indiscriminate and that the death toll was far higher than reported. Those reports have put the number of dead in the Syrian conflict at more than 21,000.\n\n\u201cWhat people have to know is that the number of dead is a far cry from what\u2019s been announced,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019d say you have to multiply by two to get the real figure.\u201d\n\nActivists in Aleppo said Sunday that the air force had destroyed a military headquarters in the Hanano area of the city just a day after a rebel assault had taken it over. Activists distributed video that appeared to show the rubble from the building and nearby homes. The Local Coordinating Committees, an opposition group that tracks the violence, said 27 civilians and opposition fighters had been killed in Aleppo on Sunday and a total of 141 across the country.\n\nAfter the bomb went off in a government-controlled area of central Aleppo, a rebel brigade, Halab al-Shahbaa, claimed responsibility along with two other units, asserting the military had turned two nearby hospitals into barracks. The rebels said they had collaborated with a military defector inside a hospital to plant the bomb, which they said had killed 200 soldiers and officers.\n\nBecause the government restricts journalists, such reports cannot be confirmed independently.\n\nIn the southern suburbs of Damascus, activists and residents said that the Syrian military had trailed residents seeking refuge in a neighborhood that grew out of the former Yarmouk refugee camp. \u201cThe killing follows us,\u201d said a 45-year-old man of Palestinian origin who gave his name as Abu Mohammad. He had fled with his family from the nearby neighborhood of Al Hajar Al Aswad back to Yarmouk.\n\n\u201cIt all becomes relative after all,\u201d Abu Salam, an activist from the Al Tadamon neighborhood who is now hiding in Yarmouk, said in a Skype interview, explaining his decision to take shelter in an area where shells were still falling. \u201cEveryone in Syria is trying to escape someplace,\u201d he added.\n\nMost of the roughly 500,000 Palestinians in Syria initially sought to stay out of the conflict, and a Palestinian militia based in Yarmouk has stayed loyal to Mr. Assad.

In a statement reported by news agencies, the council also said it had demanded that \u201call ambassadors of the Syrian regime in its lands leave immediately.\u201d\n\nRussia, along with China, vetoed an Arab-backed resolution at the United Nations on Saturday that called on President Bashar al-Assad to delegate some of his powers as part of a plan to defuse the crisis. Rebuffing harsh criticism from the resolution\u2019s sponsors and Western critics of Mr. Assad, the Russians insisted that the resolution amounted to outside interference in Syria\u2019s affairs.\n\nAt the same time, sensitive to the perception that Russia had given Mr. Assad a green light to violently crush his political opponents, the Kremlin dispatched its foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and Mikhail Fradkov, the head of Moscow\u2019s foreign intelligence service, to Syria on Tuesday. The Russians said they had a proposal that could end the crisis but declined to divulge its substance.\n\n\u201cWe have had a very productive visit with the leadership of Syria,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said, according to Russia\u2019s Ria Novosti news service. \u201cWe have confirmed our preparedness to facilitate a rapid end to the crisis based on the positions set out in the Arab League initiative. In particular, the president of Syria gave assurance that he is fully committed to an end to violence, no matter its source.\u201d\n\nMr. Lavrov also said that Mr. Assad was prepared to hold talks with representatives of Syria\u2019s opposition. \u201cIt is clear that efforts for ending the violence should be accompanied by dialogue between political forces,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we received confirmation from the president of Syria that he is prepared to cooperate in this effort.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate comment on the meeting from Mr. Assad or from the voices of opposition in Syria, who have already made clear they do not trust the government and want Mr. Assad to step down.\n\nLive video broadcast on Ad-Douniya television, a state-controlled channel, showed the Russian envoy\u2019s convoy driving along the Mazzeh highway amid cheers of thousands of government supporters. Some carried pictures of President Assad, and others held aloft banners thanking Russia and China for their veto.\n\nThe visit came a day after the American government shut its embassy in Damascus, withdrawing Ambassador Robert Ford and the rest of the staff. France said Tuesday that it was withdrawing its ambassador to Damascus for consultations, following similar moves by Britain and Italy. Unlike the United States, their embassies remain open.\n\nViolence has surged the past week in Syria, in particular around the city of Homs, Syria\u2019s third largest. The government pressed forward with its crackdown on the city for the fourth day, shelling several neighborhoods that have become strongholds of an insurgency made up of army defectors. Activists said that Syrian security forces used tanks and heavy machine guns in a push to recover the rebel-held districts.\n\nThe United Nations said in December that more than 5,400 people have been killed since the uprising broke out in March of last year. Activists say hundreds more are believed to have been killed in this week\u2019s assault on Homs.\n\nSyria\u2019s Interior Ministry said that the assault on Homs would continue until all resistance is defeated, in a sign that the government believes that it can crush the opposition by force. Since the start of the uprising, the government has maintained that it is battling armed groups financed from abroad who have killed thousands of police officers and soldiers.\n\nThe government was also pressing ahead with crackdowns in the suburbs of Damascus and a restive region in northern Syria near the town of Idlib.

He was 67.\n\nHis death was announced on the band\u2019s website. His family said the cause was congestive heart failure.\n\nThe focal point of Jethro Tull, which was formed in late 1967 and remained active into this year, was always Ian Anderson, who in addition to being the lead singer and principal songwriter is a charismatic performer and one of the few rock musicians to play flute. But the contributions of Mr. Cornick and the band\u2019s other two members \u2014 for most of his three-year tenure he played alongside the guitarist Martin Barre and the drummer Clive Bunker \u2014 did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe group typically \u201ccreates a deep, rumbling bass and guitar line and paints a breathy flute ribbon upon it,\u201d Mike Jahn wrote in a 1969 New York Times review of Jethro Tull\u2019s performance at the Fillmore East. \u201cIt maintains this through moments of loud, typically British rock bashing, and occasional passages of relatively quiet, inauspicious jazz.\u201d\n\nLike many other British rock bands of its era, Jethro Tull, whimsically named after an 18th-century British agriculturist, started out primarily playing the blues. But the group did not achieve widespread fame until its sound developed into something more ambitious and uncategorizable, incorporating elements of jazz, folk and even classical music.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with the magazine It\u2019s Psychedelic, Baby, Mr. Cornick recalled that he and his bandmates had been surprised by the reaction to Jethro Tull\u2019s second album, \u201cStand Up.\u201d \u201cWe still thought we were a blues band,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t consciously change the direction of your music. It just happens naturally, so we were all shocked when the album was released and people said, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re not playing blues anymore.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGlenn Douglas Barnard Cornick was born in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England, on April 23, 1947. He began playing bass in his teens and first worked with Mr. Anderson in Blackpool in a band that eventually evolved into Jethro Tull. Mr. Cornick played on the band\u2019s first three albums, \u201cThis Was\u201d (1968), \u201cStand Up\u201d (1969) and \u201cBenefit\u201d (1970), and on its first tours.\n\nHe left shortly before the band recorded its celebrated album \u201cAqualung\u201d and was replaced by Jeffrey Hammond. He later formed the band Wild Turkey and was a member of Paris, a group that also included the former Fleetwood Mac singer and guitarist Bob Welch.\n\nMr. Cornick is survived by his wife, Brigitte Martinez-Cornick; a daughter, Molly Cornick; and two sons, Drew and Alex.\n\nIn a statement on the Jethro Tull website, Mr. Anderson praised Mr. Cornick as someone who \u201cbrought to the early stage performances of Tull a lively bravado both as a personality and a musician.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on September 1, 2014, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Glenn Cornick, 67, Original Bassist in Jethro Tull.

And then I found myself up to my hips in the very subject I\u2019d not wanted to hear from the animal activists.\n\n\u201cThe animals here aren\u2019t raised for food,\u201d I explained. \u201cBut most of the farmers you know from the farmers\u2019 market do raise animals for food.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose farmers take good care of their pigs, and then when they\u2019re big enough, they kill them to make meat for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s sad,\u201d Dexter said.\n\nSometimes he thinks just like a 4-year-old. It\u2019s a great disappointment to me.\n\nI have been telling Dexter where meat and fish come from since long before he knew what I was talking about. When he was 2 and still had his own private language, he called the chickens in picture books \u201cbuck bucks.\u201d One day after I\u2019d saut\u00e9ed a chicken thigh and served it to him with pan juices, he smiled and said, \u201cBuck buck!\u201d as he popped a slice into his mouth. Mission accomplished, I thought. A happy, conscious carnivore.\n\nLater I tried to reinforce the connection by having him watch as I gutted a sea bass or cut up a rabbit. He\u2019d purse his lips and pretend to talk to the dead fish, or ask where the rabbit\u2019s head was. He never seemed disgusted or scared, just mildly curious. I was convinced he had a farmhand\u2019s ingrained, matter-of-fact understanding of animal protein. And then we\u2019d watch the recent movie of \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d and I\u2019d realize that little minds really couldn\u2019t care less about consistency, no matter what Emerson said. He was deeply worried about what fate lay in store for Wilbur at the smokehouse.\n\nThe smokehouse! Source of so much human happiness! At breakfast this morning Dexter sang an improvised song about the excellence of bacon, the excellence of which was instilled in a smokehouse. In the movie, the structure looms over Wilbur and his friends like Norman Bates\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d is a problematic movie for the parents of meat-eaters, but it\u2019s not the only one. Before receiving any formal education, the average American child has seen talking animals in every shape, size and species. As characters, anthropomorphic animals can be adorable (thanks to human animators) and articulate (with the right human voice-over actors). What they can\u2019t do is teach my son anything about actual animals. A New York child of the 1890s who saw carcasses hanging in butcher shops or a draft horse killed in a street accident had a clearer picture of the animal kingdom than any modern, cartoon-watching kid. If I were bent on ridding the world of meat-eating, I\u2019d start by taking over Disney.\n\nOur country goes to remarkable lengths to avoid telling the truth about meat. (I imagine the founders of the farm sanctuary might agree.) This may be why I seized Dexter\u2019s question about pigeons that afternoon at the sanctuary, because it gave me a small chance to not lie to him.\n\nThe next weekend, we saw a pig farmer named Mike at the farmers\u2019 market. As we browsed the packages of pork, Dexter pointed to one and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that red stuff?\u201d\n\nMike came right back with, \u201cThat\u2019s a little blood, Dexter.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s this going to go? I wondered.\n\nDexter grinned and said, \u201cPig blood!\u201d For some reason, the thought seemed wonderful to him. Then I showed him a plastic-wrapped trotter with a hoof attached and a few bristles still poking out of the skin.\n\n\u201cA piggy foot!\u201d he said, even more happily.\n\nThe sensitive flower of the farm sanctuary sounded as bloodthirsty as a Viking. A few nights later, he peered into a bowl of shrimp in a Mexican cocktail sauce and brightly said: \u201cHello, shrimp! You\u2019re dead!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still not sure how much Dexter understands, but I am still careful not to push him too far. Whenever we see rabbits crouching behind shrubs at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, I try to refrain from suggesting that the rabbit would taste great marinated in vinegar and wrapped in bacon. (But it would.) When we eat rabbit, every four or five months, I don\u2019t shape my fingers into bunny ears to drive the point home. He might decide at any moment not to eat another forkful of rabbit, and that would be all right with me. At least he wouldn\u2019t be able to accuse me of telling him he was eating buck buck.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page MM49 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: The Grass-Fed Menagerie.

The tests, which detect the fetus\u2019s DNA in a mother\u2019s blood or urine, are available in drugstores and online, and reports about their accuracy are likely to increase their popularity.\n\nBut the tests also raise ethical questions: whether couples will abort fetuses of an unwanted sex \u2014 as has happened in China and India, where boys now outnumber girls. The possibility discomfits many, and is also providing fuel for anti-abortion politics.\n\nThe test is the first of an expected raft of DNA tests likely to detect disorders like Down syndrome and other genetic traits early enough in pregnancy that more women may consider abortion.\n\n\u201cI think over the long run this has the potential of changing attitudes toward pregnancy and to family,\u201d said Audrey R. Chapman, a bioethicist at the University of Connecticut Health Center. \u201cWomen may be less invested in their pregnancies earlier than they are later, and the question has been raised whether women will look at their pregnancies increasingly as being conditional: \u2018I will keep this pregnancy only if.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFetal sex tests have a few medical applications, allowing couples with histories of rare sex-linked disorders to avoid costly and invasive genetic testing if they learn they are expecting the other sex. But for most couples, the tests, which are unregulated, simply answer the boy-or-girl question weeks earlier than ultrasound, and in a less invasive and safer way than amniocentesis.\n\n\u201cSeven weeks is a different time in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. James Egan, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Connecticut Health Center who was a co-author of a study on sex selection with Dr. Chapman and others. \u201cWomen haven\u2019t had the ultrasound where you see the fetus that looks like a baby. Many people don\u2019t even know that a woman is pregnant. And you can have a medical termination,\u201d using pills like RU-486, which can be used at home discreetly before 10 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThere is evidence that some Americans want to choose their babies\u2019 sex. At the Fertility Institutes, a set of clinics in Los Angeles, New York and Guadalajara, Mexico, 85 percent of roughly 500 couples each year seek sex selection, although three-quarters of them come from overseas, said Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg, the medical director.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s jumped over the past four years,\u201d said Dr. Steinberg, whose clinics determine sex through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, an embryo screening that also detects genetic disorders. He said that \u201cif a woman calls to make the appointment, the couple almost always wants a female. If a man calls, they almost always want a male.\u201d\n\nBut clinics and some ethicists say this type of sex selection is more acceptable because it occurs before embryos are implanted, before pregnancy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to prevent the abortion,\u201d said Dr. Jamie Grifo, program director for New York University\u2019s Fertility Center. His and other clinics typically allow sex selection for couples with two or more children, parents interested in \u201cfamily balancing,\u201d adding a child of the opposite sex.\n\n\u201cFor someone who has two girls and wants to have a boy, so each sibling can grow up with brother and sister, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Dr. Grifo said.\n\nStill, the cost and commitment of the fertility process makes such sex selection cases relatively unusual. Fetal DNA tests, costing between $250 and $350, are more affordable.\n\nAnti-abortion groups are incorporating sex selection in legislative agendas. Arizona and Oklahoma recently passed laws banning sex-selected abortion; a similar bill was just introduced in New York. \u201cI think you will see more states introducing it,\u201d said Mary Spaulding Balch, director of state legislation for the National Right to Life Committee.\n\nThe laws would probably not survive court challenges, said John Robertson, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Texas. But while abortion rights groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, oppose such bans, they may be less eager to fight them politically or in court because sex selection is not the most socially sympathetic motivation for abortion.\n\nAfter all, one concern is whether immigrants from countries like India and China would use sex tests to abort female fetuses here. Dr. Egan and Dr. Chapman\u2019s study found that Asian-American mothers, especially with third pregnancies, had more boys than girls in ratios strongly suggesting sex selection.\n\nSome fetal DNA test-makers are trying to discourage sex selection by not selling in China and India, and requiring customers to sign waivers saying that is not their motivation.\n\nMost mothers in Dr. Egan\u2019s data were born overseas, suggesting the possibility that American-born generations might become less concerned about having male heirs.\n\nStill, fetal DNA tests for sex determination and other traits present \u201cissues that I don\u2019t think many general obstetricians are ready to deal with,\u201d Dr. Egan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a brave new world.\u201d", "summary": "Early tests to determine the sex of a fetus raise the question of whether couples will abort fetuses of an unwanted sex.", "compression": 44.8260869565, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 4.3913043478, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}

Its fighters dominate the city center so thoroughly that a Libyan brigade sent to dislodge the group remains camped on the outskirts, visibly afraid to enter and allowing the extremists to come and go as they please.\n\n\u201cWe are going to allow them to slip out, because the less people we have to fight, the better,\u201d said Mohamed Omar el-Hassan, a 28-year-old former crane operator who leads the brigade from a prefabricated shed on a highway ringing the city.\n\n\u201cWhy make the city suffer?\u201d he said, trying to explain his delay more than 16 days after the brigade arrived in Surt.\n\nNearly four years after the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya\u2019s warring cities and towns have become so entangled in internal conflicts over money and power that they have opened a door for the Islamic State to expand into its oil-rich deserts and sprawling coastline. Libya has become a new frontier for the radical group as it comes under increasing pressure from American-led airstrikes on its original strongholds in Iraq and Syria.\n\nWhile other extremists organizations may have only sought to capitalize on the Islamic State\u2019s fearsome name, the contingent here in Surt has not only taken over a major Libyan city but also demonstrated clear coordination with the parent organization, also known as ISIS or ISIL and based in Syria.\n\nAt least one group of fighters from each of Libya\u2019s three regions has joined a wave of militant forces in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria that have publicly linked themselves with the Islamic State and its brutality.But while many of those affiliations may primarily be attempts by local extremists to capitalize on the Islamic State\u2019s fearsome name, the contingent in Surt stands apart. In addition to dominating a city of more than 120,000 residents, the Islamic State militants here have demonstrated clear coordination with the original group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, based in Syria.\n\nA recent video depicting the beheadings of Egyptian Christians kidnapped from Surt appeared to have been taped on the Libyan shoreline, but it also featured the parent group\u2019s signature audiovisual sophistication, orange jumpsuits and ceremonial knives. It was publicized in the main group\u2019s online magazine then released under its media logo.\n\nThat close cooperation so far sets the Islamic State group in Surt apart from the wave of other militants who have pledged allegiance to ISIS from Afghanistan, Algeria, Nigeria and Egypt, or even in Libya\u2019s southern and eastern provinces.\n\nBut even after the international uproar over the video, no Libyan authority has been able to take any effective action against the group. Two warring coalitions of militias have divided the country, and each \u2014 including the one that sent Mr. Hassan and his fighters, known as Brigade 166 \u2014 appears more intent on fighting the other than on thwarting the Islamic State. What is more, the battles crippled Libya\u2019s oil exports so severely that there is now a risk that the country\u2019s currency and economy will soon collapse.\n\n\u201cA currency collapse is less than two years away,\u201d Musbah AlKari, manager of the reserves department at the Central Bank of Libya, said in an interview at the bank\u2019s headquarters in Tripoli.\n\nWestern governments are keeping a watchful eye. Fighters with Mr. Hassan\u2019s brigade at the edge of Surt pointed to what appeared to be a white surveillance drone or airplane circling overhead \u2014 a daily visitor, they said.\n\nHis fighters used extreme caution when circling the city. Escorting a Western journalist on a brief visit, they were careful not to enter the city itself. To reach one point on the outskirts, Mr. Hassan brought a half-dozen trucks for protection, some mounted with artillery, and his fighters kept their guns elevated on constant alert.\n\nHis brigade had established control of the airport, Mr. Hassan said. But there were no signs that they had set up checkpoints, even at critical spots like the coastal road entering the city or the main road to the airport. \u201cSee the jihad,\u201d read graffiti on a wall along the main road outside the city.\n\nThe Islamic State controls the local radio station; during the recent visit, all four stations on the dial were transmitting Islamic sermons. \u201cThey use the radio stations to broadcast, and they are attracting a lot of people to join them,\u201d Mr. Hassan said wearily.\n\nHe and other local militia leaders, citing informants inside Surt, said they believed that the Islamic State fighters in the city numbered about 200 or less, while Mr. Hassan\u2019s brigade can command hundreds. He insisted he needed no reinforcements. But the Islamic State fighters were deeply entrenched and stronger than expected, Mr. Hassan said.\n\n\u201cWe came here with orders to go in and take over the city, but we were surprised by the numbers that joined them,\u201d he said.\n\nSince arriving, his brigade had found time to apprehend some foreign workers without visas trying to move through the area, Mr. Hassan said.\n\nBut militants suspected of links to the Islamic State had nonetheless carried out several successful attacks on nonoperational oil fields south of the city, reportedly killing several Libyan guards and abducting nine foreigners. No one has claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n\nThe rival militia coalition, based in the eastern cities of Tobruk and Bayda and under the loose command of Gen. Khalifa Hifter, describes itself as fighting to rescue Libya from Islamic extremists, including the Islamic State fighters. \u201cLibya was becoming the funding house, and they were going to export terrorism around the world,\u201d said Saqr al-Jaroushi, the air force chief under General Hifter.\n\nBut the coalition\u2019s leaders often characterize all of its opponents as extremists, including regional militias like Mr. Hassan\u2019s. Brigade 166 fighters displayed some evidence that General Hifter\u2019s coalition had been bombing their positions outside the city, even though in this case Mr. Hassan\u2019s brigade is on a mission against the same extremists.\n\nIn a pasture near the coast, the brigade fighters showed a journalist an unexploded cluster bomb, identified from photographs as a Soviet-made RBK series, near one of their positions. Similar munitions had evidently exploded nearby in recent days and left fragments of shrapnel in cup-size holes blasted into the dirt. Such weapons are banned under international law because of their indiscriminate nature.\n\nFrederic Wehrey, a researcher for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has said he saw evidence that General Hifter\u2019s planes had dropped cluster bombs on a bank and other civilian targets during fighting in the coastal town of Bin Jawad as well.\n\nIn 2011, Ben Solomon reported from Surt, Libya, Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s hometown and the site of his last stand which left much of the town in ruins.\n\nThe coalition that sent Mr. Hassan, which is known as Libya Dawn and opposes General Hifter, includes some Islamic extremist groups in the eastern cities of Benghazi, Darnah and possibly elsewhere. Its supporters often try to argue that the Islamic State fighters in Surt are merely a front for Qaddafi loyalists or supporters of General Hifter.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who have joined this group we call the Islamic State are actually remnants of the previous regime we fought in 2011,\u201d Omar al-Hassi, prime minister of a provisional government set up by the Libya Dawn coalition in Tripoli, said in an interview here. Mr. Hassi dismissed the images of beheadings in Surt as \u201ca fabricated Hollywood-like video\u201d concocted to stir trouble with Egypt.\n\nLike many in his coalition, he mentioned a television interview with an influential Qaddafi cousin outside Libya, Ahmed Qaddaf al-Dam, who at times applauded the Islamic State from an Arab nationalist perspective for seeking to erase the border between Syria and Iraq. But Mr. Dam also denounced the group\u2019s medieval Islamist ideology, saying it \u201cshows the psychological state they are in and that they need mental health treatment.\u201d\n\nSurt, near Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s birthplace, was the site of his last stand in 2011, when rebels from the city of Misurata joined a battle that destroyed much of the city. They ultimately captured Colonel Qaddafi and killed him.\n\nMr. Hassan of Brigade 166, which comes primarily from Misurata, said that history was one reason that his forces hesitated to move in. He said he feared that aggressive military action against the Islamic State could increase its support from local tribes who still resent Misurata\u2019s militias for the destruction of their city in 2011.\n\n\u201cIf we went in with both guns blazing, we would have a backlash,\u201d Mr. Hassan said.\n\nHe and other militia leaders also acknowledged, though, that the core of the Islamic State in Surt was from Misurata \u2014 a connection that could test the loyalties of other Misuratan militiamen, who are typically reluctant to fight against their neighbors or cousins.\n\nAfter Misuratan brigades moved into Surt in 2011, Mr. Hassan and others acknowledged, some continued to occupy the city and eventually turned into an extremist group, Ansar al-Shariah of Surt, a parallel to organizations of the same name in Benghazi and Derna.\n\nMore than two months ago, Mr. Hassan and others said, Ansar al-Shariah of Surt split up in a dispute over pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, and those who chose to ally with it emerged as the dominant faction. \u201cThey are the nucleus,\u201d Mr. Hassan said.\n\n\u201cYou can say that the leaders are from Misurata,\u201d Mr. Hassan said, although he insisted that would not deter his brigade. \u201cI am not here as a Misuratan.\u201d\n\nA fighter named Suliman Ali Mousa, 58, raised the theory that the Islamic State had become merely a \u201cbanner\u201d for criminals or Qaddafi loyalists.\n\nBut Mr. Hassan said that hardly mattered. \u201cIf they are raising the black flag of the Islamic State and preaching Islamic State ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cthen they are the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nSuliman Ali Zway contributed reporting from Surt, and C.

Mr. James\u2019s predecessor, Kenneth A. Gibson, who was mayor from 1970 to 1986, pleaded guilty to tax fraud in 2002 but did not go to prison. Hugh J. Addonizio, who was mayor from 1962 to 1970, served five years in federal prison after being convicted in a scheme to take $1.4 million in kickbacks from city contractors.\n\nAs for Mr. James, David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which studies public policy issues of concern to black Americans, said: \u201cHis time had clearly passed, in terms of Newark. The torch is gradually being passed, the old style of black leadership is increasingly being replaced by a younger generation.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s verdict provided an exclamation point for a city that has largely moved beyond the ostentatious reign of Mr. James, who traveled the city\u2019s crime-plagued streets in a Rolls-Royce and owned a beach house and a 54-foot yacht. Mr. James left the mayor\u2019s office in the summer of 2006 after two decades in power as well as several hard looks from prosecutors. He was also a state senator from 1999 to early 2008.\n\nThe verdict marked one of the most significant convictions won by the United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, who has successfully prosecuted more than 120 public corruption cases against Republicans and Democrats alike in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cFor 36 years, Sharpe James reigned over this city,\u201d Mr. Christie said in a news conference on the courthouse steps, referring to Mr. James\u2019s two decades as mayor and 16 years on the Municipal Council. \u201cToday he is taught the lesson: that for those who disgrace their public office, for those who betray the public trust, there is only one place for you, and that is federal prison.\u201d\n\nThe verdict provided a dispiriting bookend to a political career that began when Mr. James, a track coach and physical education teacher, emerged as a community activist in the aftermath of the riots in Newark in the 1960s.\n\nA charismatic man, he cut a larger-than-life figure in New Jersey politics, and through the years he became known for his gap-toothed grin and bubbling optimism, his wide influence in doling out patronage and a ferocity when punishing political enemies.\n\nBut after leaving the mayor\u2019s office in 2006 and with his indictment the following year, Mr. James all but disappeared from public life.\n\n\u201cMany people who are politically active in the city now are probably looking to put this behind them and, to be frank, may be breathing a sigh of relief that Sharpe James will no longer be a political presence in the city,\u201d said Brigid Harrison, a political scientist at Montclair State University.\n\nThe case that brought about Mr. James\u2019s fall centered on the purchase of nine city-owned properties that Ms. Riley bought through a special program to help revitalize the city. She paid a total of $46,000 for the properties and quickly resold them for a profit of more than $600,000 without making any renovations, as required under the city contract.\n\nProsecutors also said that Ms. Riley did not report the income she earned from the sale of the properties.\n\nMr. James was accused of improperly using his influence to steer the properties to Ms. Riley, though his lawyers contended that Mr. James had made no extraordinary or unlawful efforts on her behalf. They also maintained that Mr. James had limited ability to control the program because all sales had to be approved by the Municipal Council.\n\nMs. Riley\u2019s lawyer, Gerald Krovatin, acknowledged on the first day of arguments that she and Mr. James had an extramarital affair that lasted about six months in 2002, insisting that by the time their relationship had turned romantic most of the land sales had been completed.\n\nBut witnesses testified that Mr. James and Ms. Riley had traveled together to the Dominican Republic as recently as 2006.\n\nAnd after 16 days of testimony from 33 prosecution witnesses, some trial watchers felt that prosecutors had crafted a stronger case against Ms. Riley than against Mr. James because they did not show that Mr. James profited from the sale of the properties, and no witnesses testified about direct knowledge of a scheme to steer the properties to Ms. Riley.\n\n\u201cThis is really a risky gambit for the government,\u201d said Robert A. Mintz, a lawyer in Newark and former federal prosecutor who is an expert on white-collar crime. \u201cBecause the government didn\u2019t have that\u201d \u2014 a cooperating witness with knowledge of a conspiracy \u2014 \u201cthey relied on circumstantial evidence, on inferences and ultimately appealed to the jurors\u2019 common sense.\u201d\n\nMr. Christie acknowledged that prosecutors had more than a few nervous moments during the jury deliberations.\n\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I never had any doubts about our case. I never had any doubts about Sharpe James\u2019s guilt.\u201d\n\nAllegations of wrongdoing trailed Mr. James for years, intensifying in 1995 when he was fined $44,000 by the state election commission after he could not account for hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions. Two years later, Mr. James\u2019s chief of staff was jailed after a bribery investigation. Yet Mr. James emerged unscathed, attributing his lavish lifestyle to sound investments.\n\nOn Wednesday, those who study Newark politics were trying to gauge how severely the conviction would tarnish Mr. James\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the mayor\u2019s longstanding stature as a civic servant, as a political leader in Newark, I think the verdict will obviously cast a shadow over his personal history in Newark,\u201d said Clement A. Price, a professor of history at Rutgers University in Newark. \u201cMost unfortunately, in the minds of some, it will probably harden the stereotype of Newark as a city all too corrupt over the years.\u201d\n\nSome had worried that if Mr. James were exonerated, it would be more difficult for his successor, Mayor Cory A. Booker, who positions himself as a reformer, to accomplish his goals. But Professor Harrison said, \u201cThis verdict means Cory Booker can move forward in governing the city with a renewed sense of mission and a new kind of judicial mandate.\u201d\n\nMayor Booker called Wednesday a sad day for Newark, but said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m staying focused on the future. I hope the citizens of Newark stay focused on the important work we must do and the great things happening in the city.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. James\u2019s legacy was soiled by the conviction, on Wednesday he remained beloved on the streets. Gary McLean, 45, a city sanitation worker since 2001, credited the former mayor for lifting Newark from the ashes of the 1967 riots and said for that reason alone, Mr. James retained broad support. \u201cEverybody in this city, whether they say it or not, are still behind him,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Mr. James, the verdict means that his legal odyssey is only half over. He faces another trial, not yet scheduled, on charges that he improperly used city-issued credit cards to incur more than $58,000 in travel and other expenses for trips that he took with Ms. Riley and other women.\n\nTina Kelley, Jonathan Miller and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Former Mayor Guilty of Fraud In Newark Sales.

Hottelet, who covered the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge for CBS and became the last survivor of the \u201cMurrow Boys,\u201d the network\u2019s pioneering World War II radio newsmen who worked under Edward R. Murrow, died on Wednesday at his home in Wilton, Conn. He was 97.\n\nHis granddaughter, Maria Hottelet Foley, confirmed the death.\n\nMr. Hottelet, the youngest member of the Murrow Boys when he was hired and the last of them still with CBS when he retired in 1985, was a dogged reporter who so angered Nazi leaders while working for United Press in the war\u2019s early stages that he was imprisoned by the Gestapo for four months.\n\nMr. Murrow, the chief of CBS\u2019s news operation in Europe, who won fame for his broadcasts from London rooftops during the 1940 German air attacks known as the blitz, hired Mr. Hottelet in January 1944.\n\n\u201cOnly 26 at the time Murrow hired him, the tall, thin Hottelet was, despite a disarming smile and an elegant voice, an aggressive and sometimes abrasive reporter who refused to be intimidated by any official, Nazi or Allied,\u201d Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson wrote in the book \u201cThe Murrow Boys\u201d (1996).\n\nAs a CBS correspondent, Mr. Hottelet covered the major campaigns of the war in Europe, including the huge Allied airborne offensive across the Rhine known as Operation Varsity, during which he was forced to parachute from a flaming bomber.\n\nAfter the war he reported from Moscow, West Germany and the United Nations as one of a cadre of Murrow\u2019s wartime colleagues \u2014 among them Charles Collingwood, Eric Sevareid, Larry LeSueur and Howard K. Smith \u2014 who went on to prominent careers in television news.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we were supermen,\u201d Mr. Hottelet told The Hartford Courant in 2003, referring to the 11 Murrow Boys, one of whom was a woman, Mary Marvin Breckinridge.\n\n\u201cIt was not our job to inspire people, to educate, to move them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was our job to tell them what was going on. We were accredited war correspondents. That was it. We were serious people at a serious job. We were out in the field, flying, on the front lines getting shot at \u2014 along with a 100,000 other people.\u201d\n\nRichard Curt Hottelet was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 22, 1917, a son of German immigrants who spoke no English at home. His father had an import-export business that failed during the Depression. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1937, then enrolled, at his father\u2019s suggestion, at the University of Berlin, still unsure of his career plans.\n\nAt his first class, on the philosophy of Kant, his professor appeared in a brownshirt uniform with a Nazi armband and began the session with a Nazi salute and a \u201cHeil, Hitler!\u201d Mr. Hottelet, who had been living with a cousin of his father\u2019s, a businessman who had risked his life to aid Jewish friends, was so repelled that he dropped out of school.\n\nHe was hired by United Press in Berlin in May 1938, and two years later covered the German invasion of Belgium and France, watching the British flee to the beaches of Dunkirk.\n\nMr. Hottelet angered the Nazis when he went out after raids on Berlin by British night bombers to check the damage. And he was briefly taken into custody after closely questioning Gestapo agents whom he saw loading Jews into a truck.\n\nOn the morning of March 15, 1941, the Gestapo arrested Mr. Hottelet at his Berlin home on \u201csuspicion of espionage.\u201d He was accused of sending German military information to his girlfriend, Ann Delafield, an Englishwoman who had worked in the British Embassy in Berlin and was then in a British diplomatic office in Spain.\n\nMr. Hottelet was held in the Alexanderplatz and Moabit jails in Berlin for the next four months. He and Jay Allen, an American journalist for the North American Newspaper Alliance, who had been imprisoned by the pro-Nazi Vichy government in France, were released on July 8, 1941, in exchange for three Germans held in the United States for illegal actions.\n\nAfter working in the United Press bureau in Washington and marrying Miss Delafield in January 1942 (they would have two children), Mr. Hottelet joined the United States Office of War Information. He went to London for the O.W.I. in August 1942 to broadcast news to Germany, then moved to CBS two years later.\n\nDuring the war Mr. Hottelet flew over Utah Beach at 4,500 feet in a B-26 Marauder bomber as the first waves of troops were coming ashore in the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944. He made it back to London that day and was the first CBS correspondent to broadcast an eyewitness report of the invasion:\n\n\u201cThis is Richard C. Hottelet reporting from London. The Allied forces landed in France early this morning. I watched the first landing barges hit the beach exactly on the minute of H-Hour.\u201d\n\nIn October of that year he described the street fighting at Aachen, Germany, leaning from a window and speaking into his wire recorder as shells whistled and machine guns blasted away. \u201cRight down below us, the houses are still in German territory,\u201d he told CBS listeners, \u201cand if anybody is leaning out a bay window and draws a bead on this recorder, you will probably never hear it.\u201d\n\nIn December 1944 he told of the heavy German attack in Belgium known as the Battle of the Bulge. \u201cIt\u2019s icy cold on the front tonight,\u201d he reported, describing men having to \u201cchop at the ground with their axes and shovels.\u201d\n\nMr. Hottelet bailed out of a burning B-17 bomber hit by antiaircraft fire while covering Operation Varsity in March 1945 and landed in a cow pasture in France, incurring only minor injuries. British troops in the area treated him to liquor and tea.\n\nHe also witnessed the momentous linkup of American and Russian troops on April 25, 1945, at the Elbe River.\n\n\u201cThere were no brass bands, no sign of the titanic strength of both armies,\u201d Mr. Hottelet reported. \u201cThe Americans who met the Red Army were a couple of dust-covered lieutenants and a handful of enlisted men in their jeeps on reconnaissance. That\u2019s just the way it was, as simple and untheatrical as that. Just some men meeting, shaking hands.\u201d\n\nAfter reporting from the Soviet Union and Bonn, West Germany, during the Cold War and anchoring CBS television\u2019s daily early-morning national news program in the 1950s, Mr. Hottelet covered the United Nations for CBS from 1960 until his retirement 25 years later.\n\nMr. Hottelet was later the spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations and the host of the weekly NPR interview program \u201cAmerica and the World.\u201d He was also a foreign affairs analyst for The Christian Science Monitor, a visiting scholar at George Washington University and a contributor to a wide-ranging series of audiobooks with historical themes.\n\nMr. Hottelet\u2019s wife, Ann, died last year. Their son, Richard Peter Hottelet, died in 2008, and their daughter, Antonia Guzman, died in 1999. Besides Ms. Hottelet Foley, Mr. Hottelet is survived by three other grandchildren, Henry, Caleb and Richard Peter Jr. (who is known as Pete) and two great-grandchildren.\n\nIn February 2006, the British reprised the era of the Murrow Boys when the state-run organization English Heritage honored Edward R. Murrow, who died in 1965, by placing a blue plaque on the building at 84 Hallam Street where he lived when he made his memorable broadcasts beginning, \u201cThis ... is London.\u201d\n\nMr. Hottelet unveiled the plaque.\n\nHe said that Mr. Murrow was \u201cnever one to angle for applause or recognition.\u201d\n\nBut he added, \u201cAbout this, I think he\u2019d smile.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the day and time of Mr. Hottelet\u2019s death. It was Wednesday morning, not Tuesday night.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on December 18, 2014, on page A37 of the New York edition with the headline: Richard C.

Now the fissures have spread to the cultural realm, as filmmakers, writers and artists fiercely debate how \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or even whether \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to portray this still-visceral history.\n\nA portrait of Lech Kaczynski, the Polish president killed with 95 other officials in a 2010 crash, and his wife, Maria, at a commemorative event in Warsaw.\n\nSome leading Polish actors have refused to participate in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmolensk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a feature film to be released next year, and Antoni Krauze, its patrician 73-year-old director, fears that his views challenging the official version of events, and suggesting a cover-up, could cost the movie millions of dollars in state financing.\n\nThe makers of a decidedly sober National Geographic documentary, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath of the President,\u00e2\u0080\u009d have been accused of being pro-Russian propagandists, while a satirical underground comic book has drawn the wrath of cultural officials for its allusion to the anti-Russian mania of those who blame the Kremlin for the crash. Its antihero, Likwidator, goes on a killing spree whose targets include Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.\n\nAnd Jacek Adamas, a leading street artist here, said he had been unable to find a gallery or museum willing to display his installation of black steel sculptures of human figures with targets on their chests, suggesting that the crash\u00c2 was an assassination. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing an artist involves honesty, and in the current discourse in Polish arts, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not allowed to be honest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nAt the root of this culture war is intense disagreement about exactly what caused the disaster that day, when Lech Kaczynski, the Polish president, and his delegation were traveling to an official commemoration of the Katyn Massacre of 1940, when the Soviet secret police executed 22,000 Polish officers. For decades the Soviet government denied responsibility for the killings, which to Poles had become a symbol of Russian domination.\n\nIn the crash investigation, Russian and Polish investigators concluded in separate official inquiries that poor visibility and human error were to blame. But skeptics have variously insisted that it was an assassination, a declaration of war against Poland by Russia or perhaps an elaborate coup attempt.\n\nThe range of conspiracy theories is dizzying. So-called truthers accuse the Kremlin of pumping artificial fog over the runway, planting explosives on the plane and doctoring and then sewing victims\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bodies back together in fake autopsies. Some even contend that the Kremlin murdered Kaczynski because he had traveled to Georgia in 2008 to support that country in its war with Russia.\n\nThe crash investigation was so fraught that a military prosecutor, Mikolaj Przybyl, apparently distraught over criticism of his tactics, shot himself in the head in January 2012 during a news conference. (He survived.)\n\nMr. Krauze has rarely shied away from politics or controversy in his film career. His previous film, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Thursday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which depicted the violent 1970 crackdown on striking shipyard workers by a Polish Communist government, was popular, but it also roiled emotions in a country coming to terms with its oppressed past.\n\nThe plot of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmolensk\u00e2\u0080\u009d will center on an investigative journalist who slowly reveals a vast cover-up. Mr. Krauze said he has set out to demystify what he called a lie-riddled official narrative, and invoked \u00e2\u0080\u009cZero Dark Thirty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kathryn Bigelow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Oscar-nominated film about the American search for Osama bin Laden, as a role model. But just as \u00e2\u0080\u009cZero Dark Thirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d was pilloried by some for taking liberties with real-life events and for implying that torture is an acceptable antiterrorist tool, so critics here warn that \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmolensk\u00e2\u0080\u009d threatens to become a political statement masquerading as fact.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt hurts me when people try to politicize this tragedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pawel Deresz, a journalist whose wife, a leading leftist politician, died in the crash. He said he feared that fiction would be mingled with fact in the name of artistic freedom.\n\nBorys Lankosz, a filmmaker whose 2009 film, \u00e2\u0080\u009cReverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d depicted Polish life in the 1950s, said that conservative artists were adroitly tapping into deep-seated feelings of victimhood formed during centuries of occupation and subjugation.

In recent years, Lord Jeff has fallen out of favor with some students and faculty members because, in 1763, he endorsed giving smallpox-infected blankets to Native Americans.\n\n\u201cAs the student body at Amherst diversifies, we need a mascot that all students can feel comfortable with,\u201d Ben Walker, a senior here, said from inside the costume as he used his hoof to support its heavy head.\n\nThe push to replace Lord Jeff with a new mascot \u2014 like the moose, a dragon or even a purple squirrel \u2014 appears to be gaining momentum, as institutions around the country question their ties to historic figures who owned slaves or led Confederate battalions. But it has left some Amherst graduates and current athletes seething, affronted by what they see as a rejection of a campus tradition.\n\nThe debate over Lord Jeff has opened up a complex and, at times, tense discussion about changing campus identity at a college that, over the past 40 years, has transformed from a mostly white, mostly male institution to one that is consistently ranked among the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the nation. In 1976, Amherst was about 86 percent white, and women had begun enrolling only the year before; this year, more than half of its students identified as American minorities or international students, and the gender split is close to even.\n\n\u201cThe mascot is kind of stuck in those times, and hasn\u2019t evolved with the student body,\u201d said Virginia Hassell, a senior who is organizing the effort to make a change. \u201cThe fact that our mascot isolates people and makes anyone feel unwelcome is just unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBack at homecoming, boos rained down on the moose as it strode by members of the lacrosse team who were at the game. That was something of an improvement over last year, the first time a moose appeared at homecoming, when a couple of spectators punched the costume while Mr. Walker was wearing it.\n\nAcross the field, at a table covered in candy and holding a basket of tiny moose statues, more students were trying to make the case for the moose \u2014 or anything other than Lord Jeff \u2014 to one alum at a time.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think that changing the mascot is going to alter what has been done historically,\u201d Bill Woolverton, a member of the class of 1973, said to the students at the table.\n\nBut Micayla Tatum, a senior and the leader of the school\u2019s Native American Students Organization, pointed out that there are Native American students currently enrolled at Amherst, and she urged Mr. Woolverton to consider inclusivity. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the elite institution that\u2019s ahead of the curve,\u201d Ms. Tatum said later, \u201cand right now we\u2019re behind it.\u201d\n\nMr. Woolverton seemed unconvinced as he walked away. \u201cThere are lots of bad people in our history,\u201d he said. \u201cThomas Jefferson owned slaves. Are you going to take him off Mount Rushmore?\u201d\n\nIndeed, some Democratic groups have changed the titles of events that were named after Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, who both owned slaves. Meanwhile, Yale is considering changing the name of the residential college named for John C. Calhoun, who made moral arguments in favor of slavery before the Civil War.\n\nNative American mascots have been under pressure for years. Stanford and Dartmouth changed their mascots from the Indians decades ago \u2014 Stanford picked up the Cardinal nickname and Dartmouth the Big Green. Some professional teams, like the National Football League\u2019s Washington Redskins, have retained their names, despite criticism.\n\nStudent organizers at Amherst are hoping to hold a campus referendum on the matter by the end of the semester. And the college\u2019s president, Biddy Martin, said in a statement that the board of trustees would take up the question of Lord Jeff no later than January.\n\nLord Jeffery Amherst was a widely revered British general in colonial America, who wrote this postscript in a letter during a Native American uprising: \u201cYou will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.\u201d\n\nAmherst College was founded about 50 years later, in 1821, and named for the town, not Lord Jeffery. According to Mike Kelly, a librarian here, it was not until the first decades of the 1900s that the Lord Jeff character assumed an outsize symbolic presence on campus.\n\nIn some ways, the school has already shifted away from Lord Jeff, who has never been an official mascot. There is no longer a Lord Jeff mascot who shows up to games. But many of the school\u2019s athletic teams are called the Jeffs in the school paper or the Lord Jeffs on the field, and the name, if not the visage, appears with the name of the college on some T-shirts and sweatpants around campus, including clothing worn by the lacrosse team.\n\nUnease with Lord Jeff has grown over the past few years, but it was not until an actual moose wandered onto campus in May last year that opponents of the mascot found a new figure to rally around.\n\nThat November, the plot thickened: A black moose statue, about the size of a deer, appeared in the main library, just after Thanksgiving. The librarians here (and the pro-moose students) insist they do not know how it got there, but the statue has been in the library ever since, save for an evening when a group of students stole it for a party. It has been accepted into the library\u2019s permanent collection.\n\nSome athletes have flat-out refused to adopt the moose as a moniker; most of the students who want change say they are open to alternatives. The student government here recently published an open letter urging the school to find a new mascot. The Choral Society has already decided to stop singing the song about Lord Jeff, written here in 1905, that is something of an anthem for alumni. And on Monday, students gathered for a forum on campus to talk the matter out.\n\nSome graduates and current students have pointed out that there is no conclusive proof that General Amherst ever ordered that Native Americans be given infected blankets, and have cautioned against judging an 18th-century general by the standards of modern times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about, to use a tired clich\u00e9, fashionable political correctness, largely uninformed by deep questioning of historical events or context,\u201d said Paul Ruxin, a retired lawyer who graduated from Amherst in 1965.\n\nSome have wondered if the push for change would go further. \u201cAre they going to change the name of the school, the town?\u201d asked Robert Lucido, a 2015 graduate who is now a baseball player in the Toronto Blue Jays organization.\n\nStudents here insist that is not the goal. \u201cWe don\u2019t as students have the ability to change our school name or our town name to eradicate the injustice that was inflicted by Lord Jeff,\u201d said Gabriela Smith-Rosario, a sophomore.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on November 1, 2015, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: At College That Changed for Diversity, Some Say It\u2019s the Mascot\u2019s Turn.

Would no forests need to be cut down to create the pastures?\n\nLois Bloom Easton, Conn., Nov. 1, 2009\n\nAs an ethics instructor who aims to inspire my students to think about the connections between their values and daily practices, I found Nicolette Hahn Niman\u2019s article disappointing.\n\nBorrowing a move from the tobacco industry, Ms. Niman obscures the well-evidenced connection between veganism and environmentalism.\n\nContrary to Ms. Niman\u2019s suggestion that the findings do not apply to smaller farms, the United Nations and the University of Chicago reports demonstrate the inefficiency of beef \u201cproduction\u201d because a cow must be fed to convert grass or grain calories into protein before a human can consume even \u201chumane\u201d or grass-fed beef.\n\nMs. Niman\u2019s argument amounts to lowering an ethical standard to fit the demands of our meat-centric culture and Western privilege. Instead, we should heed the chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, who advised giving up meat for one day a week at first, and then decreasing it from there.\n\nStephanie Jenkins Highland Park, N.J., Nov. 2, 2009\n\nWhile Nicolette Hahn Niman\u2019s article demonstrates our folly in oversimplifying solutions to many of our challenges and offers many viable solutions to sustaining our lifestyles in generations to come, she leaves out one very green practice: hunting and fishing.\n\nThere is little that is less polluting and less harmful to the planet than hunting wild game responsibly. What is greener than forage-fed meat?

After noting the special criticism beef receives, she treats all meat the same.\n\nYet the turkey she raises is a much smaller factor in advancing global warming than the cattle on her ranch because they produce meat much more efficiently. Birds need only a fraction of the food that cattle do to gain a pound of meat.\n\nIndeed, in Ms. Niman\u2019s natural environment they\u2019re even more environmentally beneficial than cattle because of their diet. A \u201cfree range\u201d bird eats insects, as well as plants, so it gets more nutrition out of the same amount of land than do her cattle, which eat only the grass. They also help with pest control.\n\nThus, it\u2019s not enough to say that Americans should \u201ccut back on consumption of animal-based foods.\u201d Regardless of how much meat they eat, they need to switch from eating beef to poultry.\n\nBarry Rehfeld New York, Nov. 1, 2009\n\nThe writer is the editor of Zero Energy Intelligence.com.\n\nWhen Nicolette Hahn Niman refers to \u201ca conscientious meat eater,\u201d she is using an oxymoron.

Wright already possessed the highest doubles total in team history, and he ranks near the top of most other offensive categories.\n\nNow, with some effort in the coming weeks, he could seize another mark, by passing Ed Kranepool to become the Mets\u2019 career hits leader. Kranepool, who played 1,853 games for the Mets from 1962 to 1979, collected 1,418 hits during his career.\n\nWright, 29, ended Saturday with 1,222 games and 1,385 hits. Kranepool\u2019s mark is 33 hits away.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about becoming a franchise\u2019s all-time leader in anything, it\u2019s a nice accomplishment,\u201d Wright said.\n\nHe added that passing Kranepool would have its own significance. \u201cHe was one of those original Mets,\u201d Wright said, \u201cand he played for this organization for so long, it\u2019d be an honor.\u201d\n\nBut Wright does not place too much stock in numbers. None of the Mets\u2019 individual batting records are that high, and Wright has simply outlasted many of the club\u2019s top players, who did not spend whole careers with the Mets.\n\nAnd besides, players like Kranepool have other honors Wright wants \u2014 chief among them a World Series title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always just wanted my legacy to be that I was a winning player, and I\u2019ve never thought much about numbers or records,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the way that even bench players or role players are remembered from the \u201986 team. You see the love that the city of New York has for those guys. That would be nice.\u201d\n\nSuch concerns could perhaps play into the negotiations that will determine where Wright\u2019s future rests. The Mets hold a $16 million option on Wright\u2019s services for next season, but nothing beyond that. General Manager Sandy Alderson declared early on his intention to discuss a possible extension over the summer. But Wright countered that he wanted to hold off talks until the off-season.\n\nKranepool played his entire career with the Mets after starting as a 17-year-old. He was competent, but never a star, and that he holds the hits record is testament to the fact that stars like Keith Hernandez and Mike Piazza spent only parts of their careers with the Mets. Wright, who was drafted by the Mets as a teenager, would break that mold \u2014 if he stayed. He was asked how much the lengthy identification with a club, something that is a tradition on the Yankees but not the Mets, mattered to him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Wright said. \u201cObviously, there will be a number of factors. But I\u2019d like to think \u2014 and I think other people would agree \u2014 that I\u2019m a loyal person. From Day 1, I\u2019ve said it, and nothing\u2019s changed: I love this organization.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAlthough things haven\u2019t gone the way that we thought they were going to go, this organization has done so much for me that I think there\u2019s loyalty on both sides.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, though, Wright has preferred to avoid the big picture. After he charged into the All-Star break with 106 hits, a .351 average and 1.004 on-base plus slugging mark, Wright\u2019s production has sagged. Through 15 games in August, Wright was hitting .273 in the second half with a .711 O.P.S. Wright\u2019s slowdown had coincided with the Mets\u2019 breakdown, and Manager Terry Collins has linked the two.\n\n\u201cDavid\u2019s not swinging like he was, and we have not had anybody really step up and help him,\u201d Collins said Friday.\n\nWright acknowledged last week that second-half fatigue had set in, but he did not view that as an excuse. He said he thought he might have been trying to overcompensate for the team\u2019s overall struggles, and his coaches agreed.\n\n\u201cI think David\u2019s probably trying to do a little more than he\u2019s able to do,\u201d said Dave Hudgens, the Mets\u2019 hitting coach. \u201cThat\u2019s maybe caused a couple of little things, his body over-rotating, his elbow getting up too high.\u201d\n\nThough Wright has cooled off, Hudgens said, \u201cHe\u2019ll get hot again.\u201d\n\nIf so, Kranepool\u2019s record could be the next mark he claims. Should it happen, Wright will enjoy the moment, knowing there are other accomplishments he covets more.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s different in other cities,\u201d Wright said, \u201cbut in New York, you\u2019re remembered for winning.\u201d", "summary": "David Wright has set career Mets marks this year for runs batted in, runs, walks and strikeouts and is approaching Ed Kranepool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hits total of 1,418.", "compression": 31.2413793103, "coverage": 0.9310344828, "density": 3.8965517241, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3"}
