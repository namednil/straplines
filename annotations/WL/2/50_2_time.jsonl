Last night was a little like the buildup to Dean Kamen\u2019s \u201cGinger,\u201d the press tripping over itself to hand entrepreneur Elon Musk a megaphone, as if waiting for a robed figure to descend from the rumor-clouded mountaintop carrying a phablet with the words \u201cThou shalt build a pneumatic tube that flings people between distant cities like bank deposit slips\u201d scrolling across the screen.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s so-called Hyperloop \u2014 a slender tube filled with pods that would zip along at hundreds of miles an hour spaced just moments apart \u2014 isn\u2019t so far-fetched, steeped as it is in existing technology; indeed, some are saying Musk has invented nothing at all, that he\u2019s merely taken existing tech and shuffled it around. Regardless, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed with some of that shuffling: Fans that suck air from in front of the train to compressors that fire it from the tube bottom to keep the air pressure low? Using the air \u201ccushion\u201d generated by such a system to \u201clevitate\u201d the train a bit like a puck floating on an air hockey table? Solar panels along the tube\u2019s top \u2014 including battery packs that store energy to offset cloudy days \u2014 that provide \u201cfar in excess of the energy needed to operate\u201d?\n\nThe idea is that you\u2019d be able to walk (or drive \u2014 Musk is proposing being able to transport vehicles, too) into one of these pods every so many minutes, like queuing for the world\u2019s fastest ride at the world\u2019s longest amusement park. As Doug put it last night, \u201cThe concept seems like how a roller coaster works: line up, file into an open seat, buckle up and hold on.\u201d\n\nSo the question isn\u2019t whether it\u2019s possible \u2014 all kinds of crazy-cool-sounding things are possible \u2013 it\u2019s whether it\u2019s a good enough idea, or the best in an ocean of grand ones (maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t \u2014 just putting the question out there). The difference between a guy like Elon Musk and all the other big thinkers pitching society-changing inventions, is that he has the wherewithal to make an idea like the Hyperloop happen.\n\nOr does he? Consider some of the more obvious (and a few less so) obstacles.\n\nMusk claims the Hyperloop would be safer than flying, but has he thought it through?\n\nNothing\u2019s perfectly safe, of course, so the question\u2019s really whether something like this would be safe enough. Musk has already attempted to deflect worries about natural events like earthquakes, noting that the tube could be built to at least the specifications earthquake-resistant buildings are; that it would be \u201cimmune to wind, ice, fog, and rain\u201d; that since the propulsion system is part of the tube itself, it\u2019s inherently speed-limited by the design of each section (you\u2019re essentially removing weather and human control error, he says); and since the pods are completely contained within the tube \u2014 to say nothing of the lack of physical rails \u2014 train-style derailment is impossible.\n\nBut while the Hyperloop would include safety systems, from oxygen masks (in the event of depressurization) to emergency brakes and retractable wheels in each pod, systems like these aren\u2019t impervious to glitches, power outages, battery backup failures, etc., and the margin for error here sounds relatively slim: In a plane, you have the entire sky at your disposal (even then, air-based collisions can and do occur); in the Hyperloop, you\u2019d have up to 28-passenger cars departing every two minutes on average or every 30 seconds during peak-use periods, putting up to 70 or so pods in a tube connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco and more than twice that number in a 1,000-mile version. Given their speeds and departure intervals, they\u2019d be separated by appreciable distances, but what happens if there\u2019s a problem that forces the pods to slow or come to a stop and the brakes fail in even one?\n\nThe most serious concern, however, which Musk glosses over in his alpha paper (see section 4.5.6, \u201cHuman Related Incidents\u201d), would be terrorism, say someone managed to smuggle a bomb onboard, or fired a rocket at the tube (or one of its bracing pylons) from a distance. Remember, we\u2019re talking about tubes that could cover up to 1,000 mile stretches. Think about our southern border security issues, then imagine if that border also included hundreds or even thousands of potential human targets \u2014 locked inside tubing that might vector through huge swathes of remote areas \u2014 at any given moment.\n\nElon Musk now says he might build a prototype, but he\u2019s got a lot going on.\n\nMusk\u2019s initial position was that he didn\u2019t have time to build the Hyperloop, but as All Things D reports, he\u2019s backpedaled a bit by saying, \u201cI think it might help if I created a prototype.\u201d\n\nElon Musk is CEO and chief designer at SpaceX, a private aerospace company he founded in 2002 with around 3,000 employees and dead serious plans to establish human colonies on Mars. Musk is also CEO, chairman and product architect of Tesla Motors, the electric car company in the news recently for its unexpectedly strong earnings and again earlier this year for Musk\u2019s very public dustup with New York Times\u2018 critic John Broder. Last but not least, Musk is the chairman of a public energy company called SolarCity. In Musk\u2019s own words, talking to Businessweek about the Hyperloop: \u201cI wish I had not mentioned it. I still have to run SpaceX and Tesla, and it\u2019s fucking hard.\u201d\n\nThe point being the guy\u2019s already overcommitted \u2014 what are the odds he\u2019ll have the time, energy and resources to bring a project this audacious to fruition?\n\nThe Hyperloop may have heat dissipation and wind concerns.\n\nNoticed by USA Today, energy analyst Sam Jaffe, writing on the Navigant Research blog, says Musk\u2019s Hyperloop has at least two potential show-stopping issues the innovator doesn\u2019t address in his paper. According to Jaffe, who specializes in energy storage technologies and applications:\n\nThe biggest concern with this plan has to do with temperature. The pod will be compressing air and expelling it downwards and backwards. All that air compression creates an enormous amount of heat, which can damage the pod and its machinery. Musk\u2019s solution is to add to each pod a water tank that will capture that heat and turn it into steam to be collected at the next station. Although the thermodynamic calculations are correct, a small pod with only a few cubic feet of room for a heat exchanger leaves little space for an efficient exchange of heat. That means that the flow of water must be increased, requiring a lot more water on board. There may be an elegant solution for this challenge, but it\u2019s not in Musk\u2019s current paper.\n\nWind stress is another challenge. Any structure elevated 100 feet off the ground is going to be under a lot of wind pressure, which will act on it in weird and sometimes multiple directions. If that structure is a heavy tube stretching hundreds of miles in either direction, you effectively have a big sail. Will the concrete pylons be powerful enough to resist that pressure?\n\nThe annals of invention history are cluttered with bold ideas that went nowhere.\n\nThink Edison\u2019s Diamond Disc or Tesla\u2019s coils. Think Betamax, Nintendo\u2019s Virtual Boy, New Coke, Microsoft\u2019s Clippy, and Segway. Think Ludwig D\u00fcrr\u2019s hydrogen blimp and Da Vinci\u2019s gyrocopter. While Musk deserves accolades for putting his idea out to the public, open source-style, the chances of the Hyperloop happening when the actual costs are tallied, timeframes double-checked and potential political red tape measured\u2026well, despite Musk\u2019s claims that you could turn the Los Angeles-to-San Francisco version of this system around inside seven years, I wouldn\u2019t make plans to ring 2020 in riding this thing.", "summary": "Don't expect to be riding one by 2020.", "compression": 158.5, "coverage": 0.8, "density": 1.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

For one week, the men and women wore devices that measured their blood sugar levels every five minutes. They also used a mobile app to closely record their food intake, sleep and exercise. In addition, they filled out questionnaires about their health, and provided blood and stool samples for testing.\n\nThe researchers found that blood sugar levels varied widely among people after they ate, and these levels were highly variable even when the researchers had the people eat the exact same meal. Sometimes a food that would result in low blood sugar for one person, would cause high blood sugar for another. This information, they argue, suggests umbrella recommendations for how to eat don\u2019t do the trick.\n\n\u201cFor many years, our thinking has been that people develop obesity, diabetes and other diet-related diseases because they are not compliant with our dietary advice,\u201d lead researchers Eran Segal and Eran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel told TIME in a joint email about their findings. \u201cHowever, based on our study, another possibility is that people are in fact compliant but that the dietary advice that we are giving them is inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe a take-home message for people from our work is that if a diet did not work for you, it may be the diet\u2019s fault and not your fault,\u201d they add.\n\nWhat the researchers believe could be responsible for these differences is the microbiome\u2014trillions of bacteria that live in the gut and differ wildly from person to person. Another recent study published in the journal Obesity Research & Clinical Practice found that even if they exercised and ate the same amount, an adult in 2006 is heavier than one in 1988. The study authors also suggested that changes in the microbiome could be at play, amid other possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe are only just beginning to explore how the complex microbiome influences our physiology and health,\u201d says study author Jennifer Kuk, a professor of kinesiology and health science at York University. \u201cThis [new study] is another that shows promising evidence that the microbiome may play an important role in how we regulate body weight and could be a novel target for future weight loss interventions.\u201d\n\nSegal and Elinav say they\u2019re already moving that science forward. In their study, they also took all the data they collected and created algorithms that were able to predict how a person\u2019s blood sugar would respond to the food they ate. They say that down the line, they believe their algorithm could be used to create personalized diets for people.\n\n\u201cWe showed that the comprehensive profile that we measured can be used to achieve and design personally tailored diets,\u201d they told TIME. \u201cOur vision is to be able to derive predictions and personalized diets using a small set of inputs that people could fill out in questionnaires and a single microbiome sample, and we believe that this is both achievable in the near future and that that would be cost effective.\u201d", "summary": "And why personalized diet plans are likely the future", "compression": 73.6666666667, "coverage": 0.6666666667, "density": 0.6666666667, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The film version premieres this weekend, and devotees who have already broken records in pre-sale tickets might expect the big-screen experience to be even hotter than the book. But science suggests that they can leave their pantyliners at home.\n\nRegardless of whether director Sam Taylor-Johnson created a titillating film, researchers have found that women don\u2019t enjoy watching sex as much as they do reading about it \u2014 which means Christian Grey probably won\u2019t satisfy on the silver screen quite like he did on their Kindles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming evidence that women prefer erotica to be textual rather than visual,\u201d says Ogi Ogas, a neuroscientist and co-author of A Billion Wicked Thoughts, in which he analyzes billions of web searches and millions of erotic sites to quantify what people truly desire. He found that women make just 1 out of every 50 purchases on porn websites, but that they buy 9 out of every 10 romance novels.\n\nThere\u2019s a scientific reason women prefer to read about sex rather than see it. Historically, men have had a biological imperative to impregnate as many women as possible, so that they have the highest chance of passing on their genes. \u201cFor a man, all he needs to know is whether the woman is healthy and fertile. You can judge that visually,\u201d says Ogas. This has been demonstrated by a body of research which shows that men are more easily aroused by visual stimuli.\n\nMORE Fifty Shades of Grey and How One Sex Act Went Mainstream\n\nBy contrast, consider the biological imperatives for women, who have a limited number of opportunities to bear children and, accordingly, must use caution when picking a mate. Determining whether the man can and will take care of their children and whether he will make a good partner long-term are crucial. This has become so ingrained in our romantic ideals that even after birth control became ubiquitous and women were allowed to see sex as a means of pleasure, the fantasy persists. Even if they aren\u2019t planning on having children or are attracted to other women, Ogas says brain scans show that women need more than a hot picture to be psychologically aroused \u2014 even if they are physically. So the fantasy of learning about a man\u2019s true nature became the center of almost all erotic literature (not to mention classic literature as well, from Jane Eyre to Gone With the Wind.)\n\n\u201cWhat is he thinking? Will he be here for the long haul? These are not questions you can get immediate answers to,\u201d says Ogas. \u201cThat\u2019s why a 200-page book is so much better suited to this fantasy than a video clip. It perfectly replicates that puzzle.\u201d\n\nWhile the most popular porn site for women only receives about 50,000 visitors per month (compared to the tens of millions of male visitors to top porn sites like XVideos, YouPorn, and RedTube), millions of women buy erotic novels. Fifty Shades alone has sold over 100 million copies. And many women visit fan-fiction websites where they share and discuss erotic fantasies surrounding their favorite novels, like Fifty Shades of Grey\u2014which itself started out as Twilight fanfiction.\n\nSome sociologists have argued that women have been taught not to seek out visual porn, or that there\u2019s a dearth of female-friendly porn videos that focus more on plot. But Ogas says there are plenty of female directors making \u201cfeminism-friendly\u201d visual pornography with a narrative \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t get clicks. \u201cIf women wanted to see that kind of porn, they would seek it out,\u201d says Ogas. \u201cHuge numbers of men are routinely looking for things that weren\u2019t culturally indoctrinated in them \u2014 things you would never talk about with friends \u2014 when they\u2019re online in the privacy of their own homes. Not true for women.\u201d\n\nIn short, women\u2019s browsing habits suggest they like to leave certain things to the imagination \u2014 and their imaginations are a lot more detailed that those of their male counterparts. In a seminal study conducted at a California university in 1990 and published in the Journal of Sex Research, psychologists found that men\u2019s fantasies revolved around the physical aspects of the sex, whereas women liked to focus on details.\n\n\u201cWomen pay more attention to setting and circumstance,\u201d says Catherine Salmon, an evolutionary psychologist who studies pornography. \u201cThey\u2019re also a lot more likely to fantasize about someone they know \u2014 a current partner, a past partner, someone they would like to be a future partner, or a celebrity.\u201d\n\nMORE Before 50 Shades: Photographs of the S&M Underground\n\nBut unlike what you might find on PornHub, Fifty Shades does still have a romantic plot. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the porn version of Fifty Shades. It\u2019s still going to be a romance, albeit a kinky one, and women will enjoy that part,\u201d Salmon says. After all, they have long flocked to so-called chick-flicks. Even the most visually stimulating movies aimed at heterosexual women, like Channing Tatum\u2019s Magic Mike, fulfill the romantic fantasy. \u201cIf Channing Tatum had turned out to be an a-hole in that movie, women would not have liked it.\u201d\n\nStill, Fifty Shades fans have long imagined themselves in Anastasia\u2019s heels. Seeing that fantasy translated to the screen will likely be more enjoyable for the boyfriends dragged to this film than the female fans themselves.\n\n\u201cI suspect that if women were fans of the book \u2014 if they found it pleasurable \u2014 the movie will be a bit of a disappointment,\u201d says Ogas.\n\nDon\u2019t worry.

Instead, it's like old-school basketball \u0097 if one side opens up a lead late in the game, they stall. Hang on to the ball. Don't take chances. Force the other side to take all the risks.\n\nBarack Obama ran that classic, careful late-game offense Tuesday night in the second of three presidential debates this fall. Ahead in the polls, he was safe, cautious, disciplined and boring \u0097 and nothing John McCain attempted was enough to lure him into recklessness. By the end of the evening at Belmont University in Nashville, McCain was 90 minutes closer to running out of time.\n\nThis was the \"town hall\" debate \u0097 a format that generated a jolt of energy when it was first tried in 1992, but which is now as rote as piano scales. Candidates for junior class president no doubt know the basics: how to get up from your chair and walk gently toward the questioner; how to call her by name \u0097 first name only! (because you can relate); how to personalize your answer and strike the appropriate \"I hurt because you're hurting\" tone.\n\nFormat fatigue only helped Obama, because the town-hall-style debate doesn't feel dangerous anymore. No one is going to be caught checking his watch. No one will take the stage without memorizing the price of a gallon of milk and a gallon of gas. And because the campaigns ultimately set the rules, no audience member will be allowed to ask a question that hasn't been screened by some higher authority.\n\nSo viewers and the front runner all knew what to expect, and if you were watching closely you could see Obama's strategy from his very first answer. Of course the opening question concerned the meltdown of the financial markets. Moderator Tom Brokaw tried to get Obama to say how these events have reshaped his agenda. \"The middle class need a rescue package,\" the candidate answered, which sounded new for a moment, until he opened the package to reveal exactly the same economic plan he has been running on for months.\n\nSure enough, McCain was the one forced to gamble by proposing something new: a government program to buy out and renegotiate the mortgages of defaulting homeowners. It was big. It was dramatic. But it wasn't very Republican. Somewhere, Ronald Reagan shuddered.\n\nWhat are we to make of a debate in which the candidates agree on Warren Buffett for Secretary of the Treasury? Sounds great \u0097 but has anyone asked Warren? And in a race increasingly defined by economic issues, should McCain suggest that the best man to run the economy is a guy who has endorsed Obama?\n\nMcCain tried to rattle Obama. He talked about Obama's \"cronies\" behind the collapse of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. He jabbed a finger in Obama's direction and said \"that one\" voted for a pork-barrel energy bill.\n\nBut he never got his hands on the ball, and as basketball players know \u0097 the whole point of the stall \u0097 you can't score when the other side has the ball. \"Look,\" Obama said at one point, \"you're not interested in hearing politicians point fingers\" \u0097 knowing that pointing fingers is a way for the trailing team to score.\n\nThe stall is characterized by long periods of boredom punctuated by brief flashes of drama. Late in the debate, Obama was killing time with a stern patch of bravado: \"We will kill Bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaeda,\" and so on. How dead would that guy be by now if American speeches could kill a person?\n\nWhen McCain's turn came, he leaped in with a table-turning attack. \"My hero,\" McCain declared, is Theodore Roosevelt, who said, \"Walk softly, and carry a big stick.\" He hinted that Obama is as reckless as, well, certain highly unpopular Presidents.\n\nObama seized the ball right back. To get control, he had to trample the rules, McCain and the moderator \u0097 and he did it all without breaking a sweat. By that point, both candidates had shredded the rules of engagement, despite Brokaw's limp protests. After a bit of verbal jostling, Obama was on his feet and in the clear, once again talking smoothly in his Muzak monotone. Brokaw mumbled sadly: \"I'm just the hired help here.\"\n\n\"You're doing a great job, Tom,\" Obama replied.\n\nWhat followed was Obama's sharpest answer of the night. \"This is the guy who sang, 'Bomb, Bomb Iran,' \" he said of McCain. \"He called for the annihilation of North Korea ... That's not what I call walking softly.\"\n\nThe evening ended with an incongruous question plucked by Brokaw from thousands of online submissions: \"What don't you know, and how will you learn it?\" Obama took the mush as a signal to deliver his closing statement \u0097 a classic of the front-runner stall: when in doubt, praise the American Dream.\n\nMcCain was left with this: \"When times are tough, we need a steady hand on the tiller.\"\n\nHe once thought the town-hall format was his friend. John McCain began the general election by challenging Obama to a long series of loosely structured town-hall debates. Ultimately, he got just one. And it ended with the clock ticking down to the buzzer.\n\n(See Barack Obama's report card here.)\n\n(See John McCain's report card here.)\n\n(Click here to see the 10 Memorable Debate Moments.)\n\n(See a gallery of campaign gaffes here.)\n\n(Click here to read a Brief History of Campaign Songs.)\n\n(See a gallery of the Top 10 Campaign Ads.)", "summary": "Ahead in the polls, an unflappable Barack Obama played a careful offense in the second presidential debate", "compression": 63.5555555556, "coverage": 0.8888888889, "density": 2.4444444444, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Yet to our brains, they are virtually indistinguishable in one important respect: They are all boring.\n\nIt may seem that boredom would be the least of someone\u2019s worries in prison, but as Lorena Rivera (re-entry entitlement specialist for imprisoned women with mental illness) told us in an interview for our book, boredom is one of the toughest aspects of doing time. She said that the inmates \u201cswallow things, mutilate their skin, refuse to eat, and sometimes throw or eat their feces just so they could be moved to another facility.\u201d Why do they want to move to a different facility? They just want a change of scenery, Rivera explains. They just want to be a little less bored.\n\nHow much boredom can we tolerate? It turns out that it isn\u2019t very much. In a recent study, participants chose to administer electric shocks to themselves rather than sit in a room with nothing to do for up to 15 minutes. In another experiment, participants voluntarily shocked themselves while watching a boring film clip rather than watching passively. The same study found (less surprisingly) that bored viewers consumed significantly more M&Ms than engaged viewers.\n\nTo understand these seemingly bizarre behaviors, it helps to consider boredom from the perspective of its scientific name: hypostress. While distress is the stress of too much stimulation, hypostress is the stress of too little stimulation. Just as with distress, hypostress causes our cortisol levels to rise. But unlike with distress, we cope with boredom by seeking out more stimulation. The stimuli we choose may range from excessive TV watching and snacking to hazardous alcohol consumption and risky sexual behavior. And if we can\u2019t find a way to alleviate boredom, our brains shift into learned helplessness, and depression may follow.\n\nWhat is the cumulative impact of all these unhealthy coping behaviors? A major longitudinal study found that individuals who felt boredom frequently were more likely to die younger than those who were not bored.\n\nSo how do we eliminate boredom effectively?\n\nOur hypothesis is that the answer lies in surprise. While too much surprise can trigger anxiety, too little surprise triggers boredom. Whether we\u2019re examining an elementary school classroom or a lifeless marriage, the best question to ask isn\u2019t \u201chow can we feel less bored?\u201d but \u201chow can we add more surprise?\u201d\n\nSurprise unifies and intensifies our attention, immediately reducing inattention (one of the biggest problems of boredom). As we learned in an interview with Wolfram Schultz, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, surprise also feeds our need for stimulation, intensifying our emotions by about 400%.\n\nZoos realized long ago that animals will get depressed when they are surprise-deprived. Zookeepers help animals stay healthy and happy by giving them unexpected challenges (such as puzzles to solve) and variety (such as new toys). Not only do these enriched environments lead to happier animals, research by Donald O. Hebb that goes back as far as 1947 reveals that animals in enriched environments also learn and solve problems more quickly.\n\nThe boredom cure is remarkably similar for humans. Our brains thrive when we experience the entire surprise spectrum: variety, delight, suspense, and anticipation.\n\nIn prisons, individuals may be invited to take part in learning and creativity opportunities like the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program. In classrooms, teachers can weave in new, hands-on activities every 10 to 15 minutes. (This approach works with young kids, and, as we\u2019ve found at LifeLabs New York, it works just as effectively for adult learners.) In senior residence centers, members can be regularly introduced to new skills and ideas.\n\nIn short, any environment or aspect of our lives that has too little surprise and uncertainty is at risk for triggering boredom. When we are bored, we act out, make unhealthy choices, or just lose interest in the world around us. When we\u2019re surprised, we have no choice but to sit up, plug into the moment, and pay attention.", "summary": "We'd rather shock ourselves than be bored.", "compression": 88.4444444444, "coverage": 0.6666666667, "density": 0.8888888889, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Better technology has steadily reduced MIAs\u2014down to 7,883 in Korea, and 1,642 in Vietnam.\n\nIn Afghanistan, there was only a single American soldier missing in action. The Taliban captured Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl nearly five years ago, and finally freed him Saturday.\n\nThat was the good news. The bad news is that the U.S. government agreed to release five top Taliban officials from the prison at Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl\u2019s freedom. The five will be held by Qatar for a year.\n\nWas it a good deal?\n\nTroops who served in Afghanistan and Iraq cheered the outcome, although they expressed concern that Bergdahl may have been snatched during an unauthorized absence from his post in southeast Afghanistan on June 30, 2009.\n\nBut, as might be expected, there is a lot of unalloyed joy. \u201cAs an active participant in door-to-door, close-quarters combat in Iraq, one of the things that brought me hope was the fact that I was valued enough by my country that I knew my nation would do everything within its power to bring me home if I was ever captured,\u201d says Brock McNabb, who spent 28 months in Iraq as an Army medic with 1st Infantry Division, and now is an Air Force mental health officer. \u201cEach soldier in the U.S. is a valued treasure, and we knew that if we were ever captured, our guys wouldn\u2019t stop looking.\u201d\n\nFormer soldier Alex Horton summed up the unconditional love soldiers have for those with whom they share war. \u201cIf I had been captured in Iraq, I\u2019d hate to think about anyone risking their lives in an operation to get me back alive,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know it would happen because our ethos to never leave anyone behind is unconditional. There\u2019s not a place in the world I wouldn\u2019t go to bring back the men who served with me. That was true for combat, and it will be true for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nBut beyond human elation was caution. \u201cIs it a good deal? Probably not,\u201d says Ron Capps, who spent 25 years as an Army officer, including time in Afghanistan. \u201cBut it\u2019s also probably the only deal we could make to bring an American soldier back home.\u201d\n\nThe rules for prisoner swaps that are traditional during state-on-state conflicts don\u2019t exist in messy wars like that in Afghanistan. \u201cWe are not dealing with a signatory of the Geneva Conventions, so this looks more like a swap of spies across the Gleinicke Bridge in Potsdam than a traditional exchange of POWs after a cessation of hostilities,\u201d Capps adds, referring to the Cold War\u2019s \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d in Germany. Yet it does offer a glimmer of hope. \u201cIt does show us is that there are elements within the Taliban,\u201d Capps says, \u201cwho can be trusted to carry out diplomatic tasks like this.\u201d\n\nBut such swaps are murky affairs even when governed by the formal rules of war, which is how Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel explained it Sunday. \u201cThis was a prisoner-of-war exchange,\u201d he said flatly (although whoever held Bergdahl didn\u2019t adhere to international POW rules). \u201cHe was a prisoner.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers fear that by showing the U.S. is willing to surrender top foes for an American, Washington has just made every U.S. soldier, Marine, sailor or airman in Afghanistan\u2014or anywhere else\u2014more vulnerable to capture. \u201cThe question going forward is, have we just put a price on other U.S. soldiers?\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cWhat does this tell terrorists? That if you capture a U.S. soldier, you can trade that soldier for five terrorists we\u2019ve gone after? I mean, that\u2019s a very dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nFormer Marine William Treseder acknowledged that the still-unanswered questions surrounding Bergdahl\u2019s disappearance raise concerns. Some reports say he simply walked away from his post; others suggest he was snatched by the Taliban when he lagged behind while on a patrol. \u201cIf he was indeed off-base, or if his capture was his own fault in any direct way, then I don\u2019t think I would have the same feelings as someone captured as part of some standard combat operation,\u201d he says. \u201cThis would be survivor\u2019s guilt on a whole new level.\u201d\n\nBut speaking for himself, he adds, if Treseder fell into enemy hands through no fault of his own \u201cthen I would expect the Marine Corps\u2014not necessarily the country\u2014to figure out a way to get me back,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t authorized.\u201d\n\nPast and present military personnel are leery of the precedent the trade has created. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what the five Taliban leaders do,\u201d former Army officer Capps says, \u201cbefore we can judge the real cost.\u201d", "summary": "Troops weigh in on the wisdom of swapping one of their own for imprisoned Taliban leaders", "compression": 61.25, "coverage": 0.75, "density": 1.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Lado wipes the spittle off and licks his fingers, then leans down and dries his face in her long hair. It\u2019s icky, all right, but the scene also turns the strange intimacy of captor and captive into a little epiphany of sensuous sado-tension.\n\nAfter a decade or so of suppressing his more lurid instincts, Oliver Stone is back in the bat-crap-crazy mode that made his Oscar-winning rap-sheet rep. In turning Don Winslow\u2019s 2010 novel Savages into a movie, the writer-director returns him to his favorite early theme \u2014 the wages of drugs, in his screenplays for Midnight Express and Scarface \u2014 and the Latin American locations and ambiance of Salvador and his documentaries on Fidel Castro (Commandante) and Hugo Ch\u00e0vez (South of the Border). At its wayward best, Savages summons the craftily addled mania of prime Stone product like Platoon, Natural Born Killers and U Turn: movies about people driven to the edge of madness, in film vehicles that go over the edge with them.\n\n(MORE: Corliss on Natural Born Killers by subscribing to TIME)\n\nEarly reviewers of Winslow\u2019s book noted that it seemed ready-made for a Stone film. That may say more about the advanced age of the critics, since the novel, with its outsize bad guys and cross-border violence, would also be suited to a younger generation of meta-action pictures: Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the original script for Natural Born Killers) or Robert Rodriguez. But Stone got the gig, allowing the 65-year-old enfant horrible to reclaim the bloody territory that he founded and they appropriated and repopulated. As timely as this week\u2019s headlines \u2014 the movie actually anticipated Sunday\u2019s Mexican elections won by the Institutional Revolutionary Party \u2014 Savages is also a bicultural fantasy of a hero\u2019s blood lust and a drug boss\u2019s maternal devotion.\n\nBefore her kidnapping, O, for Ophelia, is the shared lover of soulful Ben (Aaron Johnson) and gritty Chon (Taylor Kitsch). When not enjoying groovy three-ways of bong-enhanced sex with O, the lads run a nice little Laguna Beach marijuana business, selling medicinal weed legally but making their real money shipping the stash out of state. Ben, of the wispy beard and mild disposition, is the genius chemist, a Luther Burbank of pot. Chon, a former Navy SEAL who acts as executive enforcer, came back from Afghanistan with useful guerrilla skills and a strain of grass that Ben alchemized into a plant so potent that, as the novel notes, it \u201ccould almost get up, walk around, find a lighter, and fire itself up.\u201d The two guys might be Esau and Jacob, but without the messy birthright part, or Jesus and Rambo; O calls them \u201cthe Buddhist\u201d and \u201cthe baddist.\u201d\n\n(MORE: Corliss\u2019s review of Oliver Stone\u2019s South of the Border)\n\nNow Ben and Chon have the chance to become the Ben & Jerry\u2019s of dope. That Mexican cartel, losing market share and foot soldiers to a rival operation, has proposed to distribute the lads\u2019 business for a modest 20% vig. No matter that altruistic Ben wants to chuck it all and save the Third World; the Mexicans, led by La Reina Elena (Salma Hayek) with Lado as her steel muscle, are loathe to take no for an answer. Besides, as Dennis (John Travolta), a corrupt federal agent whose dying wife Ben and Chon have been supplying with pain-relieving cannabis, tells them, you don\u2019t say no to Walmart. \u201cThis stuff\u2019ll be legal in three years,\u201d Dennis says, so get rich now. \u201cEmbrace the change.\u201d Adapt or die.\n\nIn the Darwinian negotiations with the cartel, Ben and Chon are at a serious disadvantage. They lead with Orange Country bravado \u2014 the sassy banter, the subtle sneer \u2014 while Elena\u2019s gang commandeers their computer to show them snuff videos of previous transgressors, kills one of Chon\u2019s men in his car and abducts O. They could be two surfers who stumbled into an ultimate-fighting cage with Godzilla. The boys are in the big leagues now, and their adversaries treat them with contempt; \u201cCheech and Chon,\u201d Lado calls them. In retaliation, they have only two possible ploys: seizing a huge load of cartel weed with the help of Chon\u2019s old SEALs brigade, and kidnapping Magda (Sandra Echeverr\u00eda), the daughter Magda loves.\n\n(MORE: Corliss\u2019s cover story on Oliver Stone\u2019s Platoon)\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to root for Ben, Chon and O because, I guess, they\u2019re American. And unlike Lado they don\u2019t shoot sleazy lawyers in the legs before murdering them, don\u2019t end a brief job-evaluation interview with a young underling by saying, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out, you\u2019re too sensitive,\u201d and blowing his head off. Too bad that the three heroes-by-default are pretty vapid compared with the villains. Kitsch, rebounding from less compelling leads in John Carter and Battleship, has the requisite grits for Chon; but Johnson, the young English actor who seized the screen in Nowhere Boy and Kick-Ass, can\u2019t save Ben from hippie dippiness. Lively, who got the role after Jennifer Lawrence skipped out to do The Hunger Games, shouldn\u2019t have. An insufficient siren for her lovers and a whiny captive to boot \u2014 dissatisfied by her grub, she virtually begs for arugula \u2014 O has only one function in the plot: as bait. And frankly, her life isn\u2019t shown as being worth saving.\n\nThe veterans, though, know how to have evil fun with their characters. Shea Whitman does fine by the corrupt lawyer\u2019s role, a California slime bag who goes from top dog to dead dog in about a minute flat. Emile Hirsch nails the breezy amorality of his small part as Ben and Chon\u2019s money-launderer. Hayek, in Elizabeth-Taylor-as-Cleopatra wig, has maternal gravitas to match her business-titan cojones. Travolta, 35 years into movie stardom and here brandishing an endangered-species hairline, always perks up when playing baddies; his Dennis is a bad cop and master salesman who can make any commodity seem attractive, including his own life to the murderous Lado. Del Toro, whose performances are too often the sum of their mannerisms, lives creepily inside Lado, next to whom Al Pacino\u2019s Tony Montana in Scarface is a neutered puppy. You\u2019ll be pleased that, in one of Savages\u2019 shoot-out climaxes (yes, there are two), this rancidly savory character takes longer to die than Mel Gibson\u2019s Jesus.\n\n(MORE: Corliss on the Oliver Stone-scripted Scarface)\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like the plot or the performances, just watch the damn movie. Cinematographer Don Mindel obviously looked at the grand work of Robert Richardson on 11 early Stone pictures. Mindel will backlight a face framed in gaudy red flora, and supersaturates the desert landscapes with a sickly glow that make them seem like nuclear testing grounds after the big boom. Stone and his three editors keep these hallucinogenic images churning at lunatic speed and add gimmicks of their own: when Ben and Chon must transport a stash from Laguna to Mexico in five hours, we see a countdown digital clock with a moon scampering across the screen to suggest fleeting time.\n\nThe whole picture moves like that, nearly overcoming the flaws of conflicted rooting interest and whatever qualms a Ben-like viewer might have about closeups of executions. Savages isn\u2019t great cinema, but it\u2019s a very alive movie about people who probably ought to be dead.", "summary": "In a welcome turn to his nutsy-greatsy days, the veteran director fever-dreams a drug war between California dudes and a Mexican killer cartel", "compression": 56.8928571429, "coverage": 0.6071428571, "density": 0.9642857143, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Yuri the Long-Armed, the warrior prince credited with founding Moscow in the 12th century, hangs across from Peter the Great, who had expanded the Russian empire to Europe\u2019s Baltic Sea by the time he died in 1725. What they all had in common was a thirst for expansion, which over the years has made Russia the largest country in the world. And at least by that measure, Putin in 2014 has already earned his own portrait.\n\nHis decision in March to invade and then annex the region of Crimea from Ukraine marked the first growth of Russia\u2019s dominions since the fall of the Soviet Union. Though the West remembers that event as a victory for freedom, the Soviet collapse was a catastrophe to Putin and many of his compatriots. \u201cMillions of Russians went to sleep in one country and awoke in another,\u201d Putin said in a speech at the Kremlin palace in March. Overnight, it seemed, Russia was transformed from a superpower into a corrupt petrostate, a fallen empire that Sergey Brin, the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 turned Google co-founder, once derided as \u201cNigeria with snow.\u201d\n\n(Read More: Behind the Person of the Year Images)\n\n\u201cRussia was simply pushed aside, pushed out of politics, made to feel like some kind of backwater. In everything it was America calling the shots!\u201d \u2014 Former Soviet leader Mikhail GorbachevEven Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader who tried to reform his country only to dismantle it in 1991, still broods over the loss. \u201cRussia was simply pushed aside, pushed out of politics, made to feel like some kind of backwater,\u201d he tells TIME in the Moscow office where he once received American dignitaries as equals if not exactly friends. \u201cIn everything it was America calling the shots!\u201d But with the conquest of Crimea, a derelict peninsula about the size of Massachusetts, Putin at last restored a scrap of Russia\u2019s honor, says Gorbachev, by \u201cacting on his own,\u201d unbound by the constraints of U.S. supremacy and the table manners of international law.\n\nThe vast majority of Russians would nod along. Putin\u2019s approval ratings have skyrocketed since the annexation of Crimea, reaching a peak of 88% in October. Not since 2008, when Putin last defied the West by sending Russian tanks into neighboring Georgia, has he enjoyed such popularity at home. Not during the oil-fueled boom of his first two terms as President, from 2000 to 2008, when the economy grew by an average of 7% per year, nor during the multibillion-dollar spectacle of the Winter Olympics in Sochi that Putin hosted at the start of this year. For the gift of Crimea\u2014a depressed region expected to cost Russia more than $18 billion over the next six years to develop\u2014Russians seemed ready to deify Putin. Local critics fell silent, while thousands of supporters waited hours in Red Square to buy Putin souvenirs, like a T-shirt of him lounging on a beach, the caption declaring, crimea.\n\nThat name, redolent with the history of Europe\u2019s 19th century wars, has become a byword in Russia for national revival, a taste of the imperial glory that a generation of Russians have long hungered for. \u201cIt had been extremely painful,\u201d says Lev Gudkov, a prominent Russian sociologist. \u201cOnly with the annexation of Crimea did people start to feel that our great-power status was restored.\u201d For the first time since the Soviet collapse, he says, \u201cthe sense of frustration and humiliation dissipated.\u201d\n\nThe 62-year-old Putin has savored that validation. The son of a factory worker and a former military man from the slums of St. Petersburg\u2014then called Leningrad\u2014he spent the last years of the Soviet Union as a KGB agent trying to preserve the agency\u2019s authority in the East German city of Dresden. The fall of the Berlin Wall came to him not as a liberation but as a threat\u2014in 1989 a crowd of German protesters gathered outside his office to demand the ouster of the Soviet-backed regime. As the mob threatened to storm the building, Putin burned the KGB\u2019s files and sent frantic requests for orders from his bosses in the capital. \u201cMoscow is silent,\u201d Putin later recalled in his official biography.\n\nBy the time he rose through the post-Soviet wreckage to become President in 2000, Putin had dedicated himself to rebuilding Russia\u2019s lost authority. But his attempts this year to tighten Moscow\u2019s grip on Ukraine came at a heavy price for Russia and the world. A passenger plane flying over the war zone in eastern Ukraine was blasted out of the sky on July 17, almost certainly by the ill-trained militias that Russia has been using to fight its battles. Nearly 300 people were killed, dozens of them children, as Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disintegrated over territory that Russia effectively controls through its proxies. Putin blamed the Ukrainian government for the disaster, but the callous treatment of the dead\u2014most of them Europeans\u2014cost him many of the few friends he had left.\n\nAlready expelled from the G-8 club of wealthy nations in March after the annexation of Crimea, Putin was further ostracized at the G-20 summit held in November in Australia, which lost 38 of its citizens on Flight MH17. Capturing the prevailing Western attitude at the international summit, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in greeting Putin, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll shake your hand, but I have only one thing to say to you: You need to get out of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel seemed to be the only one willing to hear Putin out. She came on the first evening of the summit to the Hilton Brisbane, where the Kremlin entourage was staying, and spent the following six hours in closed-door talks with Putin over Ukraine. The next day, Putin left the conference early, before its final declaration was announced, while Merkel delivered a speech predicting a drawn-out confrontation with Moscow. \u201cRussia flouted international law,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the horrors of two world wars and the end of the Cold War, this calls the entire European peaceful order into question.\u201d\n\nThe Germans, the centrist pragmatists of Europe, stood on principle, issuing a rebuke that helped seal Russia\u2019s political isolation just as a sharp drop in the price of oil weakened the country\u2019s most valuable asset. Inflation in Russia has spiked as a result. The ruble has lost 40% of its value against the dollar since the start of the year, forcing Russians to cut back on Western goods and foreign travel. Next year the government expects a recession to take hold.\n\nThe value of Russian government debt is approaching the level of junk bonds, and in early December, Putin was forced to cancel one of his legacy projects, the South Stream natural gas pipeline into Europe, whose construction contracts he had enjoyed negotiating personally. \u201cIf Europe doesn\u2019t want to do this, well, then it means this won\u2019t be done,\u201d Putin said, referring to pressure from E.U. regulators. \u201cWe will steer the flow of our energy resources to other regions of the world.\u201d\n\nSo, was Putin\u2019s taste of empire worth the cost to Russian prosperity? For those who carry the grudges of Russian history, it was. \u201cAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, America became a monopoly,\u201d says Alexander Voloshin, a Kremlin insider who served as Putin\u2019s chief of staff from 2000 to 2003. \u201cThey felt they had the right to punish and to praise, to give the carrot and smack with the stick,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cThere was no competition.\u201d\n\nRussia now seeks to position itself as an alternative to the Western model of liberal democracy\u2014and it\u2019s had some success. Right-wing politicians in France and the U.K., not to mention Central and Eastern Europe, are not shy about declaring their admiration for Putin. The ultraconservative government of Hungary, a member of NATO and the European Union, has announced its intention to develop as an \u201cilliberal state\u201d modeled on Russia, cracking down harshly on civil society. It is a model that may seem old-fashioned\u2014the Russian President claims not to use a cell phone and has called the Internet a \u201cCIA project\u201d\u2014but his appeal is broad and growing for the many around the world who feel left out of the 21st century. \u201cPutin doesn\u2019t want to play within the system anymore,\u201d says Michael McFaul, whose term as U.S. ambassador to Russia ended in February. \u201cHe wants to challenge it now. He wants to prod. He wants to build relationships with others against that system, with the Chinese, Turks, maybe India. That is a longer-term challenge.\u201d\n\nPutin doesn\u2019t want to play within the system anymore. He wants to challenge it now.\n\nPutin will face challenges of his own as the West begins to rally against his aggressiveness and Russia\u2019s economy falters. When TIME named Putin Person of the Year in 2007, we wrote that the President had offered his subjects a \u201cgrand bargain\u2014of freedom for security.\u201d Russians sick of the chaos of the post-Soviet 1990s eagerly accepted Putin\u2019s bargain then, but they may feel differently as the chill of economic recession and international isolation sets in. Make no mistake, though: Russians also remember that their country once dominated a sixth of the earth\u2019s landmass and stood as a global player second to none.

When she found out that she and her husband had won, she was so overwhelmed that she pulled over to the side of the road on her drive home, put her head on the steering wheel and cried. The song playing on the radio during what she called \u201cthat amazing moment\u201d: \u201cPerfect,\u201d by Pink.\n\n(MORE: What\u2019s the Best Way to Pay for Fertility Treatments?)\n\nAnother winner, Emily Heaton, experienced six failed IVF pregnancies in three years, her belly bruised from the dozens of injections required for infertility treatment. Heaton, 30, a hospital aide, and her husband Jimmy, who is stationed at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California, considered surrogacy and adoption, but not giving up. So when Heaton learned about the Sher Fertility Institute\u2019s contest for a free round of IVF, she and her husband decided to enter.\n\nThe Sher Fertility Institute is a network of clinics headed by Dr. Geoffrey Sher, a South African transplant to Las Vegas who calls the IVF giveaways a \u201creal feel-good operation\u201d that raises awareness about the plight of couples battling infertility. To enter the contest, couples must submit a video explaining why they deserve a chance to have a baby.\n\n(MORE: My Sister, My Surrogate: After Battling Cancer, One Woman Receives the Ultimate Mother\u2019s Day Gift)\n\nSher\u2019s contest rules offered little direction on what makes a winning video. It could be \u201csad, hopeful, funny, happy, sentimental or any combination,\u201d according to the guidelines. But there\u2019s really not much that\u2019s funny about failing to make a baby. All the contest\u2019s finalist videos were tearjerkers to varying degrees \u2014 tragedy is compelling. One couple who\u2019d been trying to have a baby since 2004 had burned through their savings. Another had three premature babies who didn\u2019t survive. \u201cNever in a million years would I have wanted to be in the position of judging this contest,\u201d says Heaton. \u201cIt must have been excruciating to pick who\u2019s more deserving.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the panel of judges probably shed a lot of tears watching the 45 competing videos. Their job was to submit their favorites to the institute, which then shifted the contest to Facebook: in the end, the chance to make a baby for free came down to a social-media popularity contest. For the three winners, it was fabulous. For the others, it must have felt like yet another loss. And for the rest of us \u2014 watching these tales of woe on our computer screens \u2014 it felt undeniably voyeuristic. Or perhaps it\u2019s just a sign of the times, when everybody shares everything and voting on Facebook is the ultimate democracy.\n\nThe contest is Sher\u2019s second; the first was an essay competition in December, whose winner is now pregnant with twins. You could look at the contest as an act of charity. For a procedure that can approach $20,000, giving away a free IVF cycle is by no means giving chump change. Many would-be parents can\u2019t afford the pricey treatment, in which a woman\u2019s eggs are fertilized outside the body before the hardiest embryos are transferred into the uterus.\n\nBut the contest is also a gambit, an unapologetic marketing ploy. Physicians like Geoffrey Sher recognize that their services are elective, much like those of plastic surgeons, who have also been known to host giveaways; in an increasingly crowded field, they have to promote themselves if they want to pack their waiting rooms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a publicity maneuver,\u201d says Samantha Pfeifer, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania and chair of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine\u2019s (ASRM) practice committee. \u201cWhat makes it weird is that you\u2019re creating a life, and that puts it into a different category. But if you think of it as a medical procedure you have to pay cash for, you could think of it as giving away a free car. We need a car, but we can\u2019t afford it \u2014 let\u2019s go for it.\u201d\n\nASRM doesn\u2019t regulate these kinds of contests because it\u2019s too busy being outraged that most states don\u2019t consider IVF a covered medical treatment, meaning that insurance companies don\u2019t pay for it. \u201cWe have no problem with it,\u201d says ASRM spokesman Sean Tipton.\n\n(MORE: Is It Selfish to Pursue Fertility Treatments Instead of Adoption?)\n\nYet some of the judges \u2014 I was asked to participate but declined \u2014 were uneasy with the process. \u201cIt felt like playing God,\u201d says Erika Tabke, who runs IVF Connections, a website for people going through infertility. \u201cWho\u2019s more worthy? Whose loss is more tragic? Who are any of us to judge each other?\u201d\n\nTabke found herself favoring couples who had weathered the greatest losses \u2014 a full-term neonatal death, the sorrow of three heartbeats stilled at 20 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 but felt guilty about it. \u201cAs I selected them, I thought, This is unfair,\u201d says Tabke, who applauds Sher for his generosity but doubts she\u2019ll serve as a judge again. \u201cWhat about people who can\u2019t even get pregnant?\u201d\n\nWatching the videos, I also found it impossible to ignore my subconscious biases. I gravitated toward those couples who were attractive and seemed truly, madly, deeply in love. I had a gut reaction against women who were significantly overweight; I\u2019ve written about research showing that obese women are more likely to have children with autism. They\u2019re also at increased risk of developing preeclampsia and having miscarriages or stillborn babies.\n\nWas I saying that chunky mothers are bad mothers and that good-looking couples make better parents? It seemed that way, and it felt awful. To an outsider \u2014 admittedly a very fortunate, grateful outsider who got pregnant easily \u2014 the contest seems like a cross between unwitting discrimination, outright exploitation and a wonderful opportunity to get a shot at parenthood for free.\n\n(MORE: Frozen Assets: Why American Sperm Is a Hot Commodity)\n\nSher has been performing IVF since the 1980s. In the latter part of that decade, he began giving away free cycles in his San Francisco clinic. It was a morale booster, \u201cmaking us feel we were doing the right thing.\u201d Women who won a free cycle and got pregnant were then asked to sit on a hardship committee to determine which financially insecure women should be eligible for future complimentary cycles. \u201cWe talked about how to do this in a fair and honorable way,\u201d he says.\n\nGoing from a hardship committee to a video contest on Facebook was the brainchild of Lisa Stark, Sher\u2019s director of communications. \u201cLisa thought this would create connectivity between people who are feeling alone and suffering from infertility,\u201d says Sher. \u201cWhen you see their videos, you understand their desperation. There are people out there who say this is purely a ruse to bring people into the clinic. But if you don\u2019t cry when watching them, then there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, suggests contest judge Carolyn Savage, it might have been more compassionate to structure the giveaway as a lottery. \u201cI have mixed emotions,\u201d says Savage, who made headlines in 2009 when she decided to carry to term someone else\u2019s baby after her IVF clinic mistakenly transferred the wrong embryo. \u201cI know their intentions are to bring awareness to the issue of infertility by putting 45 very compelling videos online. But I found myself taking notes about things I shouldn\u2019t have been taking notes on, like how professional their video was. Then I thought, If they can pay to get it professionally done, why can\u2019t they pay for IVF?\u201d\n\n(MORE: Mind-Body Programs Boost Pregnancy Rates for IVF Patients)\n\nOther clinics have held information sessions, attracting participants by raffling off a free cycle. And at least one other IVF clinic conducts random giveaways. In May, Dr. Joseph Hill, CEO of Fertility Centers of New England, began holding a drawing for a free IVF procedure. Any patient who signs up for an initial consultation is eligible for the twice-annual drawing. (Sher opens his contest to anyone; you don\u2019t have to be a patient.) Hill thinks a lottery is more equitable. \u201cSomeone makes them jump through more hoops?\u201d he says. \u201cThe situation is already stressful enough. To me, that seems almost cruel.\u201d\n\nIf anyone were to think it\u2019s cruel, it might be Christy Nellis. She and her husband Paul were finalists. Their story is gut wrenching, their video charming \u2014 in it, they talk about how they met and fell in love, they push each other on swings, they weep in the bedroom that they had turned into a nursery in hopes of adopting a child. Three years later, they\u2019re still waiting. Both schoolteachers, the Nellises can barely afford IVF, which is why they never attempted it in the five years they spent trying to have a baby.\n\nBut Christy says her spirits have only been bolstered by her participation in the contest. Her nephew and a friend stayed up until 3 a.m. splicing the footage together. She\u2019s gotten hundreds of e-mail messages of support. Even though she didn\u2019t win the free cycle, she says she\u2019s won other things \u2014 namely the knowledge that so many people were rooting for them. \u201cInfertility is such a lonely, isolating journey, and to have this experience of a community coming together around us has steeled me so much,\u201d she says, choking up.\n\nRochman is a reporter at TIME.

He added that he wasn\u2019t sure they should even attempt a sequel to the 1988 cult classic, said the actor getting ready to star in Spider-Man: Homecoming. \u201cThe only way to do it is to do it right,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it was improvised and so much was beautifully handmade by the artist that is Tim Burton. If you can\u2019t get close to that, you leave it alone.\u201d\n\nThat said, Keaton also admitted that he had no insider information about the actual state of the sequel: \u201cZero. You always hear things, that this is happening, and people seem to know more about it than I do.\u201d\n\nRumors about a possible sequel have circulated for years, and screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith reportedly wrote the script specifically so Keaton could reprise his role as the ghost with the most. Just last year, Winona Ryder said that Beetlejuice 2 was happening (albeit that was before her career was re-invigorated thanks to her work in Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things.)\n\nBut then in May, Tim Burton explained that while he had spoken with both Keaton and Ryder about it, there was no sequel in the works. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it\u2019s one of those films where it has to be right,\u201d the filmmaker said during a press junket for Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children. \u201cIt\u2019s not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it\u2019s not the Beetlejuice trilogy.

TIME caught up with her before the movie\u2019s Friday release to talk about her Prince Charming (Game of Thrones\u2019 Richard Madden), her ball gown and the next steps for her career.\n\nTIME: I heard that hundreds of actresses tried out for the part of Cinderella. What was the audition process like?\n\nJames: Very long and very painful. I originally went in to play Anastasia, one of the step-sisters, and I was really into it. I remember practicing the night before and I put on my most garish pink-orange tie-dye jumper. I was really up for playing a character where you didn\u2019t have to worry about being pretty, and you could just be more quirky and comical. But then when I was there, the casting director said, \u201cYou should just read for Ella while you\u2019re here,\u201d and I did. And it just felt right. In the breakdown of the character, Kenneth said she had a generous spirit. I met Ken, and then I did screen tests\u2014the whole thing took a few months, actually, until finding out. And in the screen test, in one of them, Ken played Prince Charming, which was so cool\u2014he\u2019s a really good Prince Charming.\n\nWhat scene did you read with him?\n\nThe scene on the horseback and also another scene that didn\u2019t end up in the film. I even did a scene in the kitchen, and they built this entire kitchen out of pine wood, kind of like the one in the movie\u2014not as detailed and exquisite, but I had to cook, and there was boiling water, and it all worked, and there was an oven, and there were mice that I spoke to, and I couldn\u2019t figure out if I was more scared of pretending to like mice or pretending to be able to cook.\n\nIn the real shooting you didn\u2019t have mice to talk to, right? They were CGI.\n\nNo, I had little squidgy soft toys, or I\u2019d even have tennis balls, and the sound guys would make weird squeaking sounds at me in reply. I felt like I was losing my mind.\n\nIt looked like you had great chemistry with Richard Madden, your Prince Charming, on the red carpet at the film premiere. Did you become close on the set?\n\nWe did. He was cool. Because we both were entering this world together, and for both of us it was our first big film, we bonded on that. He\u2019s a really good man\u2014he really was a real support\u2014and also we just had fun right from the start. We became like mates. We have a similar sense of humor, I think.\n\nCate Blanchett played your stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter played your fairy godmother, too. How was it working with them?\n\nTo have scenes with actors like that makes you way better. All you have to do is respond because their characters are so deep and layered and colorful and rich, so in a way you just have to enter into their moment and share the moment, and when you look into their eyes, they\u2019re telling the truth. It was the most unique acting experience I\u2019ve had. And Helena is so funny. Those scenes were such a hoot.\n\nShe must not have been on set for too many days, since she\u2019s mainly just in the transformation scene.\n\nI was so sad when she left. Actually, we did these night shoots because they built everything for real\u2014my whole garden and the house, everything was real, in the back lot of Pinewood [Studios, in London] in the forest. So we were shooting from seven in the evening til six in the morning, and it was freezing cold. We had hot water bottles and coffees, just trying to get through. It became like this parallel universe that we existed in together. We had these ridiculously gigantic skirts to navigate. Somehow, because she was there, we had a great time. She\u2019s so spectacular\u2014she just sort of improvises [in that scene].\n\nOh, really? Some of it was unscripted?\n\nYeah, loads of it. She came up with this idea that the Fairy Godmother perhaps isn\u2019t actually that good at magic, and she\u2019s a bit out of practice. So you know, all the stuff is like, \u201cWhat have you got? Have you got a barrow? A cumquat? A melon?\u201d She would try new vegetables every time, and I would genuinely be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d And Ken\u2019s great facilitating all that. He lets you go with the moment, and he\u2019s so full of life. He directs with such heart. He really inspired all that sort of energy. There\u2019s a lot of freedom.\n\nWhat about all those period costumes? They seem a little less free and more constricting. What are the best and worst parts about wearing those dresses and corsets?\n\nThe best, which outweighs everything else, was in that blue gown\u2014I felt completely transformed. And that\u2019s what fairy tales are all about: transformation. When I put that dress on, I felt like I could be a princess. But then I\u2019m glad that it only lasted a night! Or like, a movie-magic night. It was just so big, so heavy. With corsets, it\u2019s interesting when you put them on, realizing that\u2019s what women actually wore\u2014that\u2019s what they wore every day, and they\u2019re just so constricting. I\u2019m not surprised they ditched those corsets! In the blue dress it was particularly tight. On the one hand, it helps in the way you stand and the way you move, but on the other hand, it takes your breath right up into your chest. When I was trying to dance, I didn\u2019t have the capacity to breathe to support the physicality, and so I had to keep taking breaks and loosening the corset. But as I said, it was worth it.\n\nYou also wore a pretty remarkable dress for the wedding scene in Downton Abbey, which we in the U.S. have only recently seen. Will we see Lady Rose again in season 6 even though she left for America at the end of season 5?\n\nI hope so. I really hope so. It\u2019s sort of down to what Julian writes\u2014it\u2019s down to timing\u2014but I\u2019m pretty certain that that\u2019s not the end of Rose.\n\nAmericans, at least, have come to know you primarily through period pieces like Downton, and Cinderella kind of feels like a period piece. Then you have Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and War and Peace coming up. Is that a space you especially want to work in, or are you eager to take on more contemporary roles?\n\nI definitely want to do some contemporary stuff now. To be honest, when I was growing up\u2014I think it\u2019s because of Kate Winslet and Titanic\u2014I always wanted to do period. I grew up always wanting that, so I feel so happy that I\u2019ve done a lot, but I\u2019m definitely keen to challenge myself.\n\nA lot of times when people talk about Disney princesses, they\u2019re concerned about what the message will be for little girls. What do you want children to take away from this version?\n\nThe message in the film is quite clear, and it\u2019s that if you have courage, be kind, then all will be well\u2014that your strength can come from within. Oftentimes when they re-do the fairy tales, the princesses suddenly have swords and armor, that\u2019s where their strength comes from\u2014which is great, but with this one, we wanted to show that there are different kinds of strength. Any kid in the world can draw from strengths within\u2014we all have the potential with that. She manages to find joy in life even though she\u2019s having quite a bleak time and talking to the mice, imagining and dreaming. What\u2019s inside is what really matters. At the end of the film we say, \u201cThis is the greatest risk we\u2019ll ever take: to be seen as we truly are.\u201d The reason the prince falls in love with Ella is because she\u2019s such a strong, beautiful girl from the inside\u2014she challenges him and they enrich each other. That\u2019s not a very quick message. It may be the most long-winded answer ever. But I think there\u2019s lots of little messages in the film that are really strong and empowering.\n\nI read that you didn\u2019t actually wear the glass slippers in the film.\n\nThey didn\u2019t fit me. They fit the wrong girl. They didn\u2019t fit any human foot! They\u2019re Swarovski crystals, so they were on set and I would hold them and be terrified, whereas Richard Madden would be holding it and carrying away and moving around, gesticulating, and these guys in white gloves would be terrified. My friend\u2019s daughter came to visit on set, and I let her hold the slipper, and her face\u2014it was one of the most magical moments. Her eyes just lit up and the shoes were reflected in her eyes. It was amazing.\n\nRead next: This Honest Trailer for Cinderella Reminds Us How Sexist the Original Story Really Is\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.", "summary": "The actress says this Cinderella is \"not a victim\"", "compression": 174.5454545455, "coverage": 0.7272727273, "density": 0.9090909091, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "strapline", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

They had come early, hundreds of them, some as early as the night before, and all to get a glimpse of\u2014and a book signed by\u2014the woman they hope will be the next President of the United States: Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nClinton, the former Secretary of State and would-be 2016 presidential candidate, kicked off the tour for her new book Hard Choices at a Manhattan Barnes & Noble on Tuesday. Forget Iowa and New Hampshire: For a few hours, Union Square was the epicenter of American politics, with all eyes on Clinton as she promoted a book that is widely seen as a prelude to one last run at the White House.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t scheduled to arrive until 11 a.m. Not wanting to miss out, some came at 9:30\u2014the night before. Dana Watters, a 27-year-old New York grad student, said she was already behind several people in line when she arrived about 13 hours before the event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent sure what came out of my mouth [when meeting Clinton], but it was somewhere along the lines of telling her I\u2019ve been a fan of her since I was 6,\u201d Watters said.\n\n\u201cI asked her if it was too soon to call her \u2018Madame President,\u2019 and she said \u2018Hillary\u2019 was fine for now,\u201d said Bert Feldstein, a 72-year-old retired human resources worker from Long Island.\n\nClinton has said repeatedly\u2014both in remarks and in her book\u2014that she hasn\u2019t decided whether or not to seek the White House again. But with a bus sponsored by the Ready for Hillary super PAC parked outside the night before, presidential politics were the first, second and third topics of conversation.\n\n\u201cThe main reason I\u2019m here is because of my mom. She passed away two months ago, and it was her dying wish that Hillary become president,\u201d Kevin Gussiaas, a 54-year-old health care worker in New York, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who could replace her.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, convinced as anyone that the book tour is a campaign-in-waiting, wasted few opportunities to take Clinton down a peg.

Rowling's Secret: How a Forensic Linguist Figured It Out", "date": "2013072019", "text": "A man looks at the cover photo of the book \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith, a pseudonym for J.K. Rowling, on a computer screen at an office in London on July 14, 2013\n\nIt sounds like something out of, well, a detective novel: the U.K.\u2019s Sunday Times broke the news yesterday that Robert Galbraith, the \u201cfirst time\u201d writer behind the critically acclaimed crime novel The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling, was, in fact, the nom de plume of Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling. Galbraith was described as a former military police investigator with a surprising knack for language \u2014 that is, before \u201che\u201d was unmasked as the megafamous author, who told the Times that writing under a fake name was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nAs explained by the New York Times, a writer for the British paper received an anonymous tip via Twitter, in which a now deleted user claimed that Rowling was the real author of The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling. (Is it possible that the anonymous user was the book\u2019s publisher? As the New York Times notes, there\u2019s no way to rule it out.) Sunday Times editor Richard Brooks eventually confronted the publisher, but not before he investigated the similarities between Galbraith and Rowling.\n\nOne person involved in that process was Patrick Juola, a professor of computer science at Pittsburgh\u2019s Duquesne University, who was called in by the Times to analyze the Calling text.\n\n(MORE: Lev Grossman Reviews The Casual Vacancy)\n\n\u201cThe idea of looking at people\u2019s language to know who they are goes back to the Book of Judges,\u201d Juola says, referring to the history of the word shibboleth, the pronunciation of which was used to identify an enemy tribe in the biblical story of the Ephraimites. For his part, Juola has been researching the subject \u2014 now called forensic linguistics, with a focus on authorship attribution \u2014 for about a decade. He uses a computer program to analyze and compare word usage in different texts, with the goal of determining whether they were written by the same person. The science is more frequently applied in legal cases, such as with wills of questionable origin, but it works with literature too. (Another school of forensic linguistics puts an emphasis on impressions and style, but Juola says he\u2019s always worried that people using that approach will just find whatever they\u2019re looking for.)\n\nBut couldn\u2019t an author trying to disguise herself just use different words? It\u2019s not so easy, Juola explains. Word length, for example, is something the author might think to change \u2014 sure, some people are more prone to \u201cutilize sesquipedalian lexical items,\u201d he jokes, but that can change with their audiences. What the author won\u2019t think to change are the short words, the articles and prepositions. Juola asked me where a fork goes relative to a plate; I answered \u201con the left\u201d and wouldn\u2019t ever think to change that, but another person might say \u201cto the left\u201d or \u201con the left side.\u201d\n\nAs one part of his work, Juola uses a program \u2014 Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program, which is a free download available for anyone to play around with \u2014 to pull out the hundred most frequent words across an author\u2019s vocabulary. This step eliminates rare words, character names and plot points, leaving him with words like of and but, ranked by usage. Those words might seem inconsequential, but they leave an authorial fingerprint on any word.\n\n\u201cPrepositions and articles and similar little function words are actually very individual,\u201d Juola says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very, very hard to change them because they\u2019re so subconscious.\u201d\n\n(MORE: Lev Grossman Talks to J.K. Rowling)\n\nSuch clues, Juola is careful to point out, do not necessarily constitute incontrovertible evidence. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t prove that [the Cuckoo author] was Rowling, but it\u2019s a starting point,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this particular case, I wasn\u2019t that certain at all.\u201d That\u2019s because Juola was provided with relatively few texts to compare against The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling: Rowling\u2019s The Casual Vacancy, Ruth Rendell\u2019s The St. Zita Society, P.D. James\u2019 The Private Patient and Val McDermid\u2019s The Wire in the Blood. Of those four, Cuckoo showed the highest similarity to Rowling\u2019s work, but that only means the author was more likely to be Rowling than to be one of three other writers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like DNA,\u201d Juola says. \u201cIf I find your DNA at the scene of a crime, I may be able to say that the chances are billions to one that it couldn\u2019t have been any other random person \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t prove it was you. It\u2019s just very strong evidence that the jury has to consider. And one of the things that they have to consider is the possibility that you have a twin that you don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\nBut as limited as the evidence was, it apparently helped the Times reporters take their findings to Rowling\u2019s publisher, where they received confirmation of their hunch.\n\nAnd, though the beginnings of forensic linguistics may be ancient, Juola says this kind of sleuthing may be on the rise. He traces the beginnings of statistical analysis of text back to the 19th century, but the limiting factors have always been time and energy. Even when computers became available to count words, running such a study involved manual entry of every word from the book. Running a study of The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling against four other novels would probably have taken a whole team of researchers days or weeks of tedious labor. With e-books readily available, almost any book can be quickly analyzed. Rowling only got a few months of anonymity, but even that period of secrecy may not long be possible for an author of her fame.\n\nWhich is too bad for authors looking for the liberation brought by a pseudonym \u2014 or maybe not so much. Since the Times unmasked Robert Galbraith, Amazon is reporting an increase of more than 500,000% in sales for The Cuckoo\u2019s Calling.", "summary": "One of the experts who analyzed 'The Cuckoo's Calling' to uncover Rowling's authorship speaks to TIME", "compression": 59.0, "coverage": 0.75, "density": 1.65, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

I\u2019m estimating the tuition will be about $25,000 each year. I\u2019ve got about $45,000 put aside in a 529 for her. When should I tap that money?\u201d \u2014Henry Winkler, Colorado\n\nA: The first thing you and your daughter should do is fill out a FAFSA, the federal financial aid application. Even if you think your household income will be too great to qualify for aid, it\u2019s worth applying just to be certain, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com, a website that helps people plan and pay for college. \u201cI have seen many cases where families assume they won\u2019t receive any aid, but actually do qualify based on the number of children they have currently attending college or because the high costs of the tuition resulted in a lower than expected family contribution amount.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t worry that the savings you currently have in your 529 will hurt her chances for aid either. Federal aid will be reduced by no more than 5.64% of the value of the account and account distributions are not considered income, Kantrowitz says.\n\nNext, she should apply for the most available in federal direct student loans. In her first year, she can borrow $5,500. In her second year, $6,500, and any of the years following up to $7,500. Because you only get to borrow a certain amount in these direct federal student loans\u2014which have much lower interest rates than Parent PLUS loans or private loans\u2014it\u2019s worth borrowing the max each year and accruing that interest rather than waiting and trying to borrow the full cost of college her third or fourth year, says Kantrowitz.\n\nIf you have other savings accounts you can draw from, Kantrowitz recommends setting aside $4,000 a year from such an account for your daughter\u2019s college education so that you can take advantage of the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\n\nWith this credit, you get 100% of the first $2,000 you spend on tuition, fees and course materials paid during the year, plus 25% of the next $2,000. The credit is worth $2,500 off your tax bill. Also, 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable, which means you can get it even if you owe no tax.\n\nThe caveat: You will need to have a modified adjusted gross income of $80,000 or less, or $160,000 or less for married couples, a year to get the full benefit. If you earn more than $90,000 or $180,000 for joint filers, you cannot claim the credit.\n\nYou cannot use any of the funds from your 529 to qualify for the tax credit since that plan is already a form of tax-free educational assistance. If you do not have an additional $4,000 a year to put toward her education, you can also qualify for the credit by using the student loan amount she received\u2014but just know that you may not be also able to claim the student loan deduction on that amount since you\u2019ve already received a tax break on it, says Kantrowitz. (Right now you can claim both, but Kantrowitz says that could change in the future.)\n\nAfter deducting any grant aid, her student loan sum, and the $4,000 from another savings account, pay the remaining education expenses with funds from the 529 plan.\n\n\u201cUnder this plan it is likely your 529 will be exhausted after her third year of college, or sooner if you don\u2019t put aside that additional $4,000 for the tax credit each year,\u201d says Kantrowitz.\n\nTo make up the difference you\u2019ll need to secure another loan. If you own a home, consider home equity financing before PLUS loans, since the latter currently carry a 7.21% interest rate and come with an \u201corigination\u201d fee of about 4.3% of the principal amount you borrow.\n\nIf you must take the PLUS, you might be tempted to try to lock in current interest rates by borrowing to cover the first two years\u2019 worth of expenses. But you\u2019d end up having to borrow more since she\u2019ll be getting less federal loan money those first two years, and you\u2019d have to pay two more year\u2019s worth of interest. Even with possible rate increases, you\u2019re still better off taking the PLUS loans in her last two years.", "summary": "Surprise: It can make sense to mete out money in a 529 account rather than exhausting it in one year, says college financing expert Mark Kantrowitz.", "compression": 29.1379310345, "coverage": 0.7931034483, "density": 1.3448275862, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary_and_strapline", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The researchers conclude that the Ernests, Prestons and Tyrells of America are significantly more delinquent than the Michaels and Davids. Why? (See the top 10 crime stories of 2008.)\n\nThe short answer is that our names play an important role in shaping the way we see ourselves \u0097 and, more important, how others see us. Abundant academic literature proves these points. A 1993 paper found that most people perceive those with unconventionally spelled names (Patric, Geoffrey) as less likely to be moral, warm and successful. A 2001 paper found that we have a tendency to judge boys' trustworthiness and masculinity from their names. (As a guy whose middle name is Ashley, I can attest to the second part.) In a 2007 paper (here's a PDF), University of Florida economist David Figlio found that boys with names commonly given to girls are likelier to be suspended from school. And an influential 1998 paper co-authored by psychologist Melvin (a challenging first name if there ever was one) Manis of the University of Michigan reported that \"having an unusual name leads to unfavorable reactions in others, which then leads to unfavorable evaluations of the self.\"\n\nOur first names also say a great deal about the extent of privilege enjoyed by the people who picked those names for us, our parents. In the new paper, Kalist and Lee point out that previous research has shown that the name Allison is rarely given to girls whose mothers didn't finish high school but is frequently given to girls whose mothers have 17 years or more of schooling. On average, parents with less schooling are likelier to pick unpopular names for their kids. (See pictures of a diverse group of American teens.)\n\nHow do you define unpopular? For their study, Kalist and Lee accumulated all 15,012 names given to the boys born in one large state between 1987 and 1991. (To get the boys' names, the authors had to agree not to reveal the state's name.) The researchers developed an equation that gave the most popular name of the period, Michael, a score of 100. The name David got a 50. Ernest, Preston, Tyrell, Kareem, Malcolm, Alec were each given a 1. Kalist and Lee theorized that the boys with the lower-scoring names might commit more delinquent acts.\n\nWhich is exactly what they found. The relationship is quite predictable and linear: if you pick a name that's 10% more popular than Ernest (Maxwell is the example that Kalist gave me), the population of Maxwells will have 3.7% fewer delinquents than the population of Ernests. Pretty neat, right?\n\nThe name doesn't cause the crime, of course, and the way people react to the name isn't the only other factor at work. Rather, boys with unpopular names are likelier to live in single-parent households and have less money. Those with unpopular names may also find it harder to get jobs because of the negative stigma toward certain names \u0097 particularly names likely to be given to African Americans, like Kareem. And the unemployed are likelier to commit crimes than those who work.\n\nDoes this mean we all have to name our kids something boring like John? What about the Baracks who manifestly overcome their name's unpopularity ? Isn't Silverstein right: Won't a boy named Sue learn to be strong? Sometimes, yes. In a 2004 paper, Saku Aura of the University of Missouri and Gregory Hess of Claremont McKenna College point out that many African-American kids with what the authors call \"blacker\" names reap an important benefit: they have an improved sense of self as a member of an identified group.\n\nBut the preponderance of the research suggests that the improved sense of self may not overcome the discrimination toward people with unusual names. In other words, if you're trying to decide on a name for a newborn, consider Bob. It may be boring, but it's also safe.\n\nHelp Joel Stein name his baby!\n\nSee TIME's Cartoons of the Week.", "summary": "Research shows that unpopular names are more likely to lead to a life of crime", "compression": 60.4, "coverage": 0.8, "density": 1.3333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

My son started college this past fall, and he\u2019s already talking about transferring. I keep thinking he just needs time to adjust to college life and the heavier academic workload (no matter where he goes). Is there any rule of thumb for how long kids should give a college before transferring?\n\nIt\u2019s extremely stressful as a parent to have your beginning college student phone home in misery. There are so many new and uncomfortable transitions your son, and all freshmen, have to make, and it\u2019s heartbreaking to listen to stories of unhappiness.\n\nThere\u2019s no rule of thumb for deciding how long to push him to stick it out before transferring because each student\u2019s situation is different. However, there are a number of steps you and he should take before beginning the transfer process.\n\nStep 1. Correctly diagnose the problem or problems. Are these issues specific to this college? Are they related to the whole process of transitioning to college? Are they related to a real mismatch between student and this college? He needs to figure out whether he might be better served at another college or if he simply hopes that, magically, by simply changing his location, everything will be better. Some students forget they are taking themselves with them wherever they go.\n\nAs a parent, your response should be listening and asking questions to help your son tease apart what\u2019s making him unhappy. When I advise students who seek my help in transferring I ask many questions before discussing anything else. In other words, the WHY needs to answered before the WHEN or WHERE.\n\nStep 2. Encourage your son\u2019s resilience by assuring him that making transitions is a life skill that takes time, support, and work. Encouraging what researchers call \u201cstudent engagement\u201d is very important; joining organizations and student activities helps a students \u201cfind their place\u201d on campus and feel like they belong. Also, you can assure him, as you\u2019ve probably done, that most freshmen, even including his friends who seem outwardly happy, are likely inwardly quaking. Being uncomfortable is common.\n\nStep 3. Step back as his parent and not try to solve his problems yourself. Your son should be strongly encouraged to take advantage of the many sources of support on his campus. Remember, colleges are very concerned about student retention and have numerous support services, which you\u2019re paying for, to help him. And learning to advocate for himself is an essential maturing experience.\n\nWe know that one the hardest things for college students to do is admit they need help. The next hardest thing for students seems to be remembering everything they were told during orientation about where to get that help. That\u2019s where you can help a bit\u2014encourage him to reach out.\n\nStep 4. Come to a conclusion about whether his problems are solvable only by changing colleges and are not due to lack of engagement or issues that he might bring with him to any college.\n\nStem 5. If he has carefully gone through these decision-making steps and believes transferring is the best solution, I usually advise completing a full freshman year first. That\u2019s the time it takes for clear-headed thinking, rather than an emotional, rash \u201cget me out of here\u201d reaction.\n\nIt also allows time to get full benefit of campus supports as well as for the student to create a stronger full-year transcript. In addition, transfer applications usually require a specific essay explaining the reasons. Taking the time to understand himself will allow your son to write a thoughtful and persuasive personal statement to make his case for transferring.\n\nLora Block is a certified educational planner in private practice for over 20 years at College Advisory Services.

In an interview with the New York Times\u2019 David Carr, he laughed off the suggestion that he was pursuing \u201ca kind of new journalism\u201d:\n\nWe are making jokes about the news and sometimes we need to research things deeply to understand them, but it\u2019s always in service of a joke. If you make jokes about animals, that does not make you a zoologist. We certainly hold ourselves to a high standard and fact-check everything, but the correct term for what we do is \u201ccomedy.\u201d\n\nStrictly on the basis of language, I have to applaud Oliver for rejecting the label of \u201cjournalism.\u201d Though I\u2019ve often used it myself for lack of a better catchall word, it\u2019s a stupid word, used to lend an air of professional respectability to jobs that we should just describe directly: writing, reporting, analysis, criticism, opinion and so on.\n\nThere\u2019s a kind of protesting-too-much, this-is-so-a-real-job overtone to the word. There\u2019s also an element of judgment: journalism is not just reporting, but reporting of which I approve; not just non-fiction writing or speaking, but nonfiction writing or speaking that I deem worthy of respect. That\u2019s probably, as with Jon Stewart in the past, the popular reading of the term that Oliver balks at. If he accepts the label journalist, he sounds full of himself, and that\u2019s the death of comedy.\n\nBut if we\u2019re going to use the term journalism at all, I don\u2019t see how it doesn\u2019t apply to the work done by Oliver and Last Week Tonight. (Which, incidentally, is produced by onetime magazine writer Tim Carvell, who years ago edited some pieces of mine at Fortune.) There\u2019s far more to news and nonfiction today than who-what-where-when-why reporting. One of the biggest growth fields is \u201cexplainer journalism\u201d\u2013analyzing data and walking an audience through complex issues, often done with a distinct point-of-view, at outlets like Vox and FiveThirtyEight. [Update: For an in-depth comparison of Oliver\u2019s work with that of people who actually call themselves journalists, see The Daily Beast\u2019s Asawin Suebsaeng.]\n\nThat\u2019s journalism; a news analysis is journalism; an editorial is journalism. The chief difference between these and what Oliver does, if anything, is that he\u2019s entertaining, so that, when he spends fifteen minutes arguing the stakes of net neutrality, people actually pay attention and even act on it. If that makes it \u201cnot journalism,\u201d then it\u2019s journalism that has the problem.\n\nNot that I blame Oliver for avoiding the label. When someone calls Oliver, Stewart or Colbert a journalist, it\u2019s often because that person wants something\u2013for the hosts to commit themselves to a certain cause or to declare neutrality; for them to commit to a certain seriousness of purpose; for them to accept their \u201cresponsibility,\u201d however the labeler defines it; for them to fit into some one-size definition of how a journalist should behave and what they should care about. That would definitely kill Oliver\u2019s comedy, and along with it his\u2013well, analysis or advocacy or whatever you want to call it.\n\nSo yes, John Oliver is a \u201cjournalist\u201d as much as anyone in this business is.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., gives victims\u2019 families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks that killed thousands in New York, the Washington, D.C., area and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe House still must act on the legislation.\n\nRelatives of Sept. 11 victims have urged the Obama administration to declassify and release U.S. intelligence that allegedly discusses possible Saudi involvement in the attacks.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir denied earlier this month that the kingdom made any threats over the bill. He said Riyadh had warned investor confidence in the U.S. would shrink if the bill became law.\n\n\u201cIn fact what they (Congress) are doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities, which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle,\u201d Al-Jubeir said in a May 3 statement.\n\nThe Treasury Department said Monday that Saudi Arabia in March held $116.8 billion in Treasury debt.\n\nPassage of the bill sends the message that the United States \u201cwill combat terrorism with every tool we have available, and that the victims of terrorist attacks in our country should have every means at their disposal to seek justice,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nSchumer said that any foreign government that aids terrorists who strike the U.S. \u201cwill pay a price if it is proven they have done so.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats had firmly supported the legislation, putting them at odds with the Obama administration. The White House has said the bill could expose Americans overseas to legal risks, and spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday efforts to revise the legislation fell short in addressing the administration\u2019s concerns about preserving sovereign immunity.\n\n\u201cGiven the concerns that we\u2019ve expressed, it\u2019s difficult to imagine the president signing this legislation,\u201d Earnest told reporters at the White House.\n\nSchumer was confident the Senate had the necessary two-thirds vote of the chamber to override a presidential veto.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think their arguments stand up,\u201d the New York lawmaker said at a news conference after the Senate action.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate subcommittee that controls foreign aid, had blocked the bill from moving to the Senate floor until changes were made to ensure the legislation didn\u2019t backfire on the United States.\n\nGraham\u2019s apprehension was rooted in the possibility a foreign country could sue the United States if the door is opened for U.S. citizens to take the Saudis to court. Graham released his hold earlier this month, clearing the way for Senate action.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also had warned that the legislation, if passed, would alienate Saudi Arabia and undermine a longstanding yet strained relationship with a critical U.S. ally in the Middle East.\n\nSchumer said it is false to claim that the bill encourages retaliation or litigation against the United States.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not busy training people to blow up buildings and kill innocent civilians in other countries,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly and Josh Lederman contributed to this report.", "summary": "The Obama administration threatened to veto the legislation", "compression": 87.5, "coverage": 0.875, "density": 1.875, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

The landscape was scorching and inhospitable, and for the recent college graduate, as foreign a world as he could have found.\n\nOn this land \u2014 marked by the remnants of the world\u2019s oldest known cave paintings and still trodden by today\u2019s remaining nomadic tribes \u2014 Naughten found a world of crises and celebrations \u2014 the twisted braids of culture and colony that have given birth to modern Namibia.\n\n\u201cNamibia was a country of contrasts and paradoxes,\u201d Naughten writes. \u201cI was hooked.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, it was the Herero tribe that would bring Naughten back, some 15 years after watching his first sunrise over Namibia\u2019s eastern expanse. This time, with digital camera in hand, Naughten set out across the desert by car, camping each night, and photographing throughout each day \u2014 from weddings to funerals and all ceremonies in-between.\n\n\u201cFor me the Herero story, illustrated by the amazing costumes and uniforms, is one of survival, pride and defiance,\u201d Naughten told TIME. The process of photographing his subjects on a landscape silently marked by the fingerprints of history, gave the Conflict and Costume gravity \u2014 the images tugged at something deeper.\n\nIn part, that \u201csomething deeper\u201d is the colonial experience \u2014 a force communicated through the Herero\u2019s adoption of Germanic-style military or dress attire. Namibia, is bordered by Angola to the north, Zambia to the east, South Africa to the south and the Atlantic ocean to the west, and came under German rule in 1884 \u2013 a political decision thought to forestall British Colonial expansion from South Africa up the western coast.\n\n\u201cThe project led me to read a great deal of colonial history,\u201d said Naughten, noting that the story of the German Herero war is not widely known at all.\n\nGerman occupation led to decades of indigenous struggle, which almost led to the extinction of the Herero people. Specifically, the German-Herero war between 1904-1907 resulted in the loss of nearly 85 percent of the Herero population.\n\n\u201cNamibia\u2019s colonial history is extremely complex and fascinating,\u201d said Naughten. \u201cBut amidst twists and turns are stories of the most unbelievable inhumanity.\u201d\n\nBut from those struggles have grown an obsession with dress \u2014 or costume \u2014 amongst the Herero.\n\nNaughten told TIME that, according to custom, whenever a Herero warrior would kill a German soldier they would take his uniform, considered to be a badge of honor and an act that would symbolically \u201ctake their power.\u201d\n\nToday, many of the uniforms are merely bartered, bought or sold, but the influence of the early German colonial wares has led the Herero to adopt other more European elements of fashion. In this remote corner of the Namib, European style of dress has become a celebrated aspect of the modern Herero\u2019s identity.\n\nInterestingly, despite a fervor for military marches and battle dress, the Herero people no longer have a traditional standing army. The parading men are mere community groups, who march for display, accruing respect and rank by virtue of their frequency of attendance, as well as the appearance and quality of their uniform.\n\nThere\u2019s little or no political motivation behind the work, Naughten said. His process, and his approach to photography, is based on a basic method: find a story, explore with the camera, and make pictures of where the story takes him.\n\nUnlike his first trip to Namibia, however, digital photography has limited Naughten\u2019s ability to share his work with his subjects.\n\n\u201cIt was much easier when I was able to give Polaroids to the people I photographed.\u201d he said. \u201cNow with the digital technology it\u2019s not possible, and very few people I worked with had access to email.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the value that Conflict and Costume might provide, Naughten refers to the curiosity that kept him engaged with Namibia throughout the years.\n\n\u201cI would like people to become more interested in Namibia and aware of the history, and just maybe pick up some further reading.\u201d Naughten said.\n\nJim Naughten is a photographer based in London. His book, Conflict and Costume, will be released March 1, 2013 by Merrell. This work will also be shown from March 5th \u2013 April 13th at the Margaret Street Gallery in London, and from March 14th \u2013 May 4th at Klompching Gallery in Brooklyn, N.Y..

Yet, he tells TIME, these photographs don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\n\u201c[Behind the story] of almost every brutalized woman, there\u2019s a man. But somehow, it\u2019s become a women\u2019s issue and their burden. They have to learn how to cope with the things that we, men, do, and we\u2019re sort of left off the hook. The question should be: \u2018How can we stop this from happening in the first place?\u2019\u201d\n\nWith financial support from the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa, Muller has spent the last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) photographing and talking to men \u2013 soldiers and civilians. His goal is to \u201cunderstand the causes of male-perpetrated violence,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking at length with these guys about their impression of what being a successful man means. For example, in Congo, I found traditional ideas of manhood, where a man has to provide for his family and defends it. So, I ask them whether they feel they fit that definition. I\u2019m working around the hypothesis that when men are not able to achieve what are often rigid standards of what makes successful manhood, they become extremely anxious and volatile, and they will revert to dangerous and violent behavior in order to try to assert themselves as men.\u201d\n\nIn the DRC, a country in tatters after two decades of conflict and civil war, men and soldiers have experienced an unimaginable level of trauma, says Muller. \u201cIn society, a soldier with a gun is seen as a powerful man, but within the structure of the military, these guys are often unpaid for months at a time, they can\u2019t provide for their families, they are often on combat operation consistently, sometimes for years. They get no home leave; they get little rations or equipment. And they get zero psychological support.\u201d\n\nWhen Muller has managed to talk with these soldiers, the results have been surprising, he tells TIME. \u201cThey\u2019re used to foreign journalists asking them about the war, so when I ask them about their childhood, their fathers and their kids, the emotional outpouring is really touching.\u201d\n\nThese conversations will form part of Muller\u2019s body of work. \u201cI\u2019m still figuring out what the best concept will be for this,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put anybody in a dangerous situation, so I\u2019ve included portraits of men I didn\u2019t speak with, and there are people that I did talk to but didn\u2019t photograph. And I\u2019m giving everybody anonymity. I don\u2019t even share first names.\u201d\n\nMuller plans to continue the work in South Africa and Namibia, and he hopes to find further funding to add Palestine and the U.S. to his list. \u201cI think this issue is universal,\u201d he says. \u201cMyself, I was raised to be quite masculine \u2013 playing football, fist fighting. It took me a long time to be in touch with myself and get away from that social posturing. People talk about photography as therapy, and I know some disagree with that, but for me, this work is very therapeutic.\n\nPete Muller is a photographer based in Kenya.

As far as gun-related homicides go, we're beat out by Finland at 3.64 and France (yes, France!) at 3.00. We top the charts on suicides, by only by a little - Switzerland has 5.61. And our gun-related accidents are closely followed up by Canada, at 0.22.\n\nOur education system could certainly use some work. The US ranks 13th on the UN's education index from 2007, having moved down from 12th. We're behind such excellent systems as Finland, Denmark, Australia, Canada, and Norway, to name a few. However, we still outperform Spain, Sweden, Belgium, France, Italy, the UK, Germany, Israel, Switzerland... the list goes on.\n\nWe can be pretty sexist, though I'm not sure how to quantify that. If we go by percentage of senior executives who are women, then in 2011 the US did pretty poorly at 15%. But, that's better than Switzerland and Denmark (both 12%), Germany at 11%, or Japan at 8%. Alternatively, we could use the percentage of government positions held by women, which in 1996 (I can't find more recent data) was 33% in the US - including 14% of ministerial-level positions. Compare that to... well... pretty much everyone. France had 10% (including 14% of ministers), Italy had 7% (and 3.6% of ministers), and the UK had 6% (8% of ministers).\n\nAs a country, we're undoubtedly racist and xenophobic - but again, this is difficult to quantify. I did find a survey ranking countries by diversity of their workforce - the US ranked 9th out of 50, below Norway, New Zealand, Iceland, Australia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, and the Phillipines; but above Sweden (10th) , Denmark (13th), the UK (17th), Germany (23rd), Japan (37th), Italy (41st), etc. Using just the \"country of birth\" metric of diversity in their survey, we rank above Canada, the Netherlands, and Norway. While that doesn't say much about actual attitudes among the people, I would point out that, additionally, the US has managed to elect someone from a perceived minority to two terms in the presidential office; to the best of my knowledge, this cannot be said of chancellors in Germany, or prime ministers in the UK, and I haven't checked the rest of Europe yet.\n\nHomophobia is also a real problem in the US, but again - perhaps not more so than other developed countries. I leave it to you to find metrics for this, as it's a mess of legal situations and attitudes. It's worth remembering, though, that nine states in the US, plus the District of Columbia, the Coquille Tribe, and the Suquamish Tribe, all recognize full marriage for same sex couples. The Defense of Marriage Act made marriage laws a state-level decision, so it's a patchwork of legislation. Compare this to, say, France, or the UK, where same-sex marriage is illegal but there are civil unions, or Italy or Greece, which don't recognize any same-sex union.\n\nAs for communism and socialism - these are loaded words in our political rhetoric, and mean things in the US that they don't mean elsewhere. Actual socialism is fairly prevalent - viewable in such institutions as Social Security; unemployment insurance; Medicare and Medicaid; government-run power production as with Long Island Power Authority or the Tennessee Valley Authority; or even the concept of eminent domain.\n\nIt's also important to remember, whenever you discuss what \"Americans\" think, that the US has 50 states, the District of Columbia, about 330 recognized tribes, and around 16 territories, for a total of 314,924,000 people. The US covers 3,790,000 square miles. Talking about the US is less like talking about the UK or France or Italy, and more like talking about the European Union, which covers 1,707,787 square miles and has a total population around 503,500,000.", "summary": "Perhaps, but a new survey of American values reminds us what real exceptionalism means", "compression": 60.6666666667, "coverage": 0.6666666667, "density": 0.8, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

Also on view for the first time at the parade was a lumbering RS-24 Yars ICBM launcher along with several new, smaller vehicles.\n\nVictory Day is Russia\u2019s most important secular holiday, both commemorating the Soviet Union\u2019s huge suffering in the war and highlighting Russia\u2019s portrayal of itself as a force for peace and security. This year\u2019s parade, on the 70th anniversary of the surrender, was the biggest military parade since the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.\n\nIn his speech to the assembled troops and veterans, President Vladimir Putin said that the carnage of the war underlined the importance of international cooperation, but \u201cin the past decades we have seen attempts to create a unipolar world.\u201d That phrase is often used by Russia to criticize the United States\u2019 purported aim to dominate world affairs.\n\nLater Saturday, an estimated 300,000 people walked through central Moscow to Red Square, holding portraits of relatives who fought in the war. Putin joined them near Red Square, with a photo of his naval veteran father.\n\nThe observances were shadowed by the near-complete absence of European leaders from the ceremony. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is to come to Moscow on Sunday, a visit that will include recognition of the Red Army\u2019s sacrifices.\n\nThe cold shoulder that European leaders turned toward Victory Day underlines the tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis. As Western sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine continue to bite, Russia has increasingly appeared to pivot away from Europe and focus more on developing relations with China.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping was the most prominent world leader to attend the Victory Day parade and Putin took special note in his speech of China\u2019s role in the war, saying that like the Soviet Union \u201cit lost many, many millions of people.\u201d\n\nAn air of grievance mixes with the annual commemoration of the Nazi defeat, with Russians frequently complaining that the West undervalues the Red Army\u2019s role and even tries to \u201crewrite history.\u201d\n\nEgyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who met with Putin after the parade, echoed that strain. \u201cNo one can deny the role that Russia, the Soviet Union, played in the fight with Nazism and history will never forget,\u201d he said.\n\nFor veterans of the war, in which the USSR is estimated to have lost 26 million people including 8 million soldiers, the parade was an intensely emotional experience.\n\n\u201cWhen we fought, we had a couple of automatic pistols and a rifle \u2014 now look at all the amazing military equipment we\u2019ve got,\u201d said 92-year-old Valentina Schulgina, who fought in the Battle of Stalingrad that is regarded by some as the bloodiest battle in history.\n\nIn all, about 200 pieces of military hardware and 16,500 troops took part in the parade, which concluded with a flyover of military aircraft. One group of warplanes flew in a tight formation depicting the number \u201c70.\u201d\n\nThe Armata tank that was one of the highlights of the parade is regarded by some military analysts as surpassing Western tanks. It is the first to have an internal armored capsule surrounding its three-man crew and a remotely controlled turret with an automatic loading system.\n\nOther prominent figures at the parade included Alexander Zaldostanov, the leather-clad leader of the nationalist motorcycle club Night Wolves, with whom Putin has ridden.\n\n\u201cThere are three things to say after the parade today: The enemy will be destroyed; victory will be ours; Russia forward,\u201d said Zaldostanov, known as The Surgeon.", "summary": "President Vladimir Putin took a swipe at the U.S. in his speech", "compression": 63.3333333333, "coverage": 0.8333333333, "density": 2.0, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

That\u2019s according to a new report released by Human Rights Watch on Monday morning local time.\n\nThe report, succinctly titled Living in Hell, provides a grim portrait of Indonesia\u2019s neglect and abuse of its mentally ill population. It pays particular attention to the practice of pasung \u2014 placing those with \u201creal or perceived psychosocial disabilities\u201d in \u201cshackle[s] or locked up in confined spaces,\u201d which persists across the country despite a national ban in 1977. According to the report, 18,000 Indonesians currently live in pasung, with viable mental-health-care alternatives either inaccessible or nonexistent.\n\nThe report notes that the culture of mental-health care in Indonesia relies heavily on backward pseudo-science rooted in dated spiritual traditions. The report\u2019s authors observe a \u201cwidespread belief that mental health conditions are the result of possession by evil spirits or the devil, having sinned, displayed immoral behavior, or lacking faith.\u201d (In Indonesia, many also condemn homosexuality as a mental disease.) Because of the stigma that shrouds mental illness, families tend to deliver their sick loved ones not to medical treatment but to spiritual healers.\n\nPasung is a hallmark of this method of \u201ctreatment.\u201d In these cases, patients are constrained, often naked, and in many cases left outdoors for days to years. The Human Rights Watch report estimates that as many as 57,000 people in Indonesia \u2014 nearly 15% of all seriously mentally ill people in the country, by some estimates \u2014 have been subjected to pasung at least once (the figure is higher in rural regions).\n\nOn paper, the Indonesian government condemns this practice as inhumane. Six years ago, the country\u2019s Health Ministry embarked on an ambitious mission to completely eliminate pasung from the country by 2014 \u2014 a deadline recently extended to 2020. In 2014, the parliament passed the Mental Health Act, a piece of legislation written to further the \u201cpromotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation\u201d of mental illness.\n\nHowever, this commitment has yet to yield tangible returns. Less than 1% of Indonesia\u2019s national health care budget goes to funding mental-health-care treatment, according to psychiatrist and former Indonesian lawmaker Dr. Nova Riyanti Yusuf in an essay published in the Jakarta Globe last year. \u201cThere is a lack of political will,\u201d she tells TIME.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report also addresses the fundamental scarcity of the country\u2019s mental-health-care resources: in a country of 250 million \u2014 it is the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation after China, India and the U.S. \u2014 there are only between 600 and 800 psychiatrists, or one for every 300,000 to 400,000 people. There are also only 48 mental hospitals in the country, many of which are characterized by \u201cseverely overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.\u201d At one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta, the country\u2019s capital, around 90 women live in a room built to accommodate around 30. The report documents rampant sexual and physical abuse ranging from unwanted sexual contact to subjecting patients to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without providing anesthesia.\n\nEight of the country\u2019s 34 provinces have no mental hospitals whatsoever.\n\n\u2014 With reporting by Yenni Kwok", "summary": "It is one symptom of a mental-health-care system many say is broken and backward.", "compression": 34.3157894737, "coverage": 0.8947368421, "density": 3.2105263158, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed", "annotation": "summary", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}

So what happened?\n\nWhen the song first premiered last May, reactions ranged from contempt (Rolling Stone\u2018s Jody Rosen called it \u201ca drag\u201d) to praise (\u201ca sweeping epic,\u201d Entertainment Weekly declared). And despite Del Rey\u2019s polarizing position in pop culture \u2014 she\u2019s either considered an inauthentic construct cooked up in major label board meetings or The Most Beautiful Poet In The Land Of Gods & Monsters \u2014 the general consensus remained more or less the same: \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d was the most quintessentially Lana Del Rey song that Lana Del Rey had ever recorded.\n\nThe song soon went on to become Del Rey\u2019s most commercially successful song since her October 2011 debut \u201cVideo Games,\u201d rising to an all-time peak of #22 on the Billboard Hot 100. (She would later shatter that record with Born To Die\u2018s \u201cSummertime Sadness,\u201d thanks in large part to a club-ready remix by EDM maestro Cedric Gervais.)\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that the song was met with Oscar buzz. But by the time the nomination window came rolling around toward the end of 2013, \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d was already mired in scandal.\n\nAccording to a Deadline report from December, an anonymous envelope was \u201cmailed to various members of the Academy\u2019s music selection committee,\u201d which included a print-out of a fake Variety web article alleging that Lana\u2019s song was somehow ineligible for the Best Song nomination due to \u201ca technicality involving The Great Gatsby\u2018s changed release date.\u201d Upon further investigation, Academy members realized that the article was in fact doctored. (Stop me if you\u2019ve already seen this plot play out in a Hitchcock flick \u2014 or maybe Clue.)\n\nInsiders said attempts to figure out the sender were unavailing, so the studio and Interscope focused on setting the record straight with the Oscar committee member who reported receiving the missive and others who might have. Warner Bros, which has several songs from the Baz Luhrmann-directed film on the just-release long list of 75 eligible tunes, is now recutting a music featurette to emphasize the collaboration between Luhrmann and Del Rey on the song, which plays in the scene where Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) regales Daisy (Carey Mulligan) with the grandeur of his mansion. And yes, the song is Oscar-eligible.\n\nBy the time nominations were announced, the damage may already have been done: The song was left off of the final list of nominees \u2014 even after a second controversy swept the category. (Yes, really.)\n\nUpon the announcement of the official nominees in mid-January, one song in particular stuck out as a fairly unusual entry: Composer Bruce Broughton\u2019s \u201cAlone Yet Not Alone,\u201d the title track of a small, independent Christian film, which brought in less than $150,000 at the box office.\n\nBy the end of the month, the curiously below-the-radar selection had been pulled from the category \u2014 which has happened a mere handful of times in the history of the Academy Awards. So why was it removed? Because of an e-mail reportedly sent from Broughton to 70 members of the Academy, politely encouraging them to consider his song for the nomination. But the message alone wasn\u2019t enough to cost the song the nomination: It was the fact that Broughton is an executive committee member of the music branch of the Academy, and previously acted as an Academy governor up until 2012. As a result, his influence on voters was called into question.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the Academy was right in pulling Broughton\u2019s nomination, the fact remains that \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d sat there in silence, shedding a lone, glamorous tear while a battle of technicalities raged on in front of her innocent eyes.\n\nYou could blame the mystery envelope, which could have come from any number of nominees, or perhaps a nefarious pop star rival vying for the nomination from the same soundtrack \u2014 et tu, Fergie? (Kidding!) You could blame the subtle shades of insider trading that led to the eventual disqualification of one entry. Or just blame the fact that the Great Gatsby producers decided to throw five (5!) songs up for nomination from its own soundtrack. But whatever the reason, Lana was ruthlessly, sincerely snubbed.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the song would have stood much of a chance for victory, to be fair: Judging by the general response from the public, Frozen\u2018s ubiquitous \u201cLet It Go\u201d (the soundtrack from which it hails has hit #1 on the Billboard 200 5 times this year) and Pharrell\u2019s inescapable-yet-undeniably-infectious Despicable Me 2 theme \u201cHappy\u201d (which just hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week) are the most likely victors in the category. But Lana deserved the recognition. (Hey, at least the Satellite Awards had the decency to award Lana for Best Original Song.)\n\nMoreover, Lana\u2019s far too busy putting the finishing touches on her Born To Die follow-up Ultraviolence with The Black Keys\u2019 Dan Auerbach (among other rumored collaborators) to be bothered about some award, anyway. (It would have been nice to see her work the red carpet in some gorgeous gown \u2014 but I digress.)\n\nThere\u2019s only one question that remains when it comes to Lana Del Rey: Will you still love her when she\u2019s no longer snubbed and ineligible?", "summary": "The singer's <i>Gatsby</i> theme \"Young and Beautiful\" was brutally snubbed at the Oscars \u2014 and some suspect foul play", "compression": 44.2692307692, "coverage": 0.5384615385, "density": 0.8461538462, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive", "annotation": "summary_and_strapline", "annotator": "3", "marked_as_extractive": false}
